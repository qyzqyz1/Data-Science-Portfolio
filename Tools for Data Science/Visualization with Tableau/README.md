# Tableau Visualization Projects

- [Story for Asylum Seekers](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yizhe.qu#!/vizhome/MyFirstTableauStory_16/StoryforAsylumSeekers): This is my first Tableau project, in which I have created a story with separate plots and a dashboard for the audience to explore the number of refugees by country and year.
