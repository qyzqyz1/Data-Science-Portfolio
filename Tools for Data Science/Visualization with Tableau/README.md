# Tableau Visualization Projects

- [Story for Asylum Seekers](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yizhe.qu#!/vizhome/MyFirstTableauStory_16/StoryforAsylumSeekers): This is my first Tableau project, in which I have created a short storyline with separate plots and a dashboard for the audience to explore the number of refugees by country and year.
- [Market Sales in Europe](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yizhe.qu#!/vizhome/CustomerSalesinEurope_0/Dashboard): My second Tableau practice project, where I developed an interactive dashboard for users to analyze customer market sales in Euorpe by geographical locations and year. 
- [Bank Balance Segmentation in U.K.](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yizhe.qu#!/vizhome/BankBalanceSegmentationinU_K_/Storyline?publish=yes): This Tableau project presents the customer segmentation of bank balance in the United Kingdom. The analysis is broken down respectively into distributions by country, balance, age, gender, and job classification.
