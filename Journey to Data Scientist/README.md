# Professional Development (on the go)

Hi, I'm Yizhe(Tom) Qu. My passion for data science is driven by my immense fascination of how industries are transforming from content-centric models to consumer-centric paradigms. From entertainment, banks, and social media, survival is now embedded in the ability to offer the best-differentiated audience experience to increase customer satisfaction, growth, and product value. I want to be at the center of this entire data deluge, creating sustainable data-driven solutions for corporations.

To be part of the movement, I have been consistently honing my data science skills through both my Master of Data Science program as well as my independent online trainings. Below is a brief summary of my professional development timeline (**_to be continued_**):
