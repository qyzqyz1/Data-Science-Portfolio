# Machine Learning Projects in R

- [Supervised Learning Tasks in R](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/R%20Projects/R%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Supervised%20Learning%20Tasks): Various tasks involving implementations of supervised learning models in R (e.g. LDA, QDA, k-nearest neighbours, association rule mining, PCA, logistic regression, and neural network).  
	
- [Unsupervised Learning Tasks in R](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/R%20Projects/R%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Unsupervised%20Learning%20Tasks): Various tasks involving implementations of unsupervised learning models in R (e.g. hierarchical clustering, k-means, mixture models, multidimensional scaling, factor analysis, PCA, and non-negative matrix factorization).   
	
- [Predictive Modelling - Seismic Timing Dataset Project](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/R%20Projects/R%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Predictive%20Modelling%20-%20Seismic%20Timing%20Dataset%20Project): Analyzed seismic timing dataset and compared the performances of several different predictive models (e.g. multiple linear regression, bivariate spline regression, thin-plate splines, and generalized additive model (with normal and gamma family)).
