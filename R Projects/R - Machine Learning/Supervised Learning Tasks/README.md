### Task1
- Compared model outputs from **LDA, QDA, k-nearest neighbours** on the `bank data`
### Task2
- Implemented **Association Rules Mining** on the `okcupidprofiles data` which contains OkCupid dating proles from the San Francisco region for interesting patterns.

### Task1
- For the `car93 data`, performed **Principal Component Aanalysis (PCA)** on the numeric variables with interpretations of the loadings of the first couple of PCs
- Used **Kaiser Criterion** to keep the suggested number of PCs
- Further performed i) **Logistic Regression** and ii) **LDA** on the data and computed their corresponding logloss values

### Task2
- Fitted a **Neural Network** on the `car93` data set to predict car price using all other quantitative variables
- Calculated the deviation of the predicted values from the true values
