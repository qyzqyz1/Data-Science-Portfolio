# Unsupervised Learning Tasks Description
## [Assignment-1](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/R%20Projects/R%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Unsupervised%20Learning%20Tasks/Unsupervised%20Learning%20Task1)
### Task1
- Performed **hierarchical clustering** on the `bank data`
### Task2
- Run **k-means** on the `lots.Rdata` with different random starts
### Task3
- Run **Mclust** on the `lots.Rdata` under all default settings and compare the results with k-means
### Task4
- For the `asim.Rdata` Using unsupervised methods on the predictors in tandem with linear modelling, find a model with an R2 and adjusted R2 both greater than 0.99.  


## [Assignment-2](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/R%20Projects/R%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Unsupervised%20Learning%20Tasks/Unsupervised%20Learning%20Task2)
### Task1
- For `HouseVotes84` data set, compared performances of various unsupervised learning models (**hierarchical clustering, multidimensional scaling, k-means, and mixture models**)
### Task2
- For the built-in covariance matrix `ability.cov`, compared output reuslts from several **Factor Analyses** with different covariance matrix configurations
### Task3
- For the MNIST database, conducted **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** on the images
- Reconstructed approximations of the original observations using the first 25 PCs
- Reconstructed approximations of the original observations using 25 NMF bases
- Fitted a classification tree with labels as the response variable and the NMF scores as the predictors.
