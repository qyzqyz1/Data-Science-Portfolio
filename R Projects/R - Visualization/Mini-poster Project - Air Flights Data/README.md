# Mini-Poster Project for Air Flights Data (Basic Data Visualization in R)
## Project Overview
This repository contains code  and datasets for analyzing the delay situation associated with American airlines in the year 2008. A specific focus was given to the U.S. Airway company and four different types of charts were created to visualize the delay conditions with respect to months and airport locations.

Furthermore, a mini-poster was created in pdf format to present our findings to the general public who would be interested to know some general insights about the delays occured for the U.S. Airway in 2008.

## File Description
- **data_sets**: contains partial datasets for the American flights and airports information in the year 2008. The complete *air.csv* file can be downloaded from: http://rtricks4kids.ok.ubc.ca/wjbraun/DS550/air.csv
- **outputs**: contains four different types of baisc plots created through R
- **Final_Poster.pdf**: mini-poster in pdf format that is used to present our findings
- **Miniposter.r**: R scripts in R format
- **Miniposter.ipynb**: R scripts in ipynb format

## Package Requirements:
To successfully run the R script, you need to first install the following packages in R by running `install.packages("package_name")`:
- **plotrix** package: Contains lots of plots, various labeling, axis and color scaling functions.
- **rworldmap** package: Enables mapping of country level and gridded user datasets.

## Practiced Skills:
- Data Cleaning
- Data Manipulation
- Data Visualization
- Data Analytics
- Storytelling
