# Unit Testing and Travis CI

## Project Description
In this project, I worked collatively with another group member - Jimmy Ding to develop a customized Python Package. The package we chose to build is the areaCalculator package which it is used to calculate the areas for various common shapes based on user inputs. More deatailed information regarding this package can be found inside the [areaCalculator](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Software%20Engineering%20Projects/Building%20Python%20packages%20and%20Unit%20Testing/areaCalculator) folder.

After the package was built, five unit testing classes were created to validate the performance of our package. Those test classes were then collected by a test suit and the test suit was checked to ensure it can call the test classes properly.

In the last step, we integrated try-except syntax into our unit testing classes developed earlier to handle errors and exceptions gracefully. The codes are checked with coverage report to ensure maximum coverage (100%) is achieved. 

Continuous Integration testing is also setup using Travis and below is a status image showing the status of our build.
