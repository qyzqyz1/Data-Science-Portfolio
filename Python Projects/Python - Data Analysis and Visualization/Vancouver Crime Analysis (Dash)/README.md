# Vancouver Crime Data Analysis (Dash)

## Project Description
In this project, I explored Vancouver's public crime dataset from [this link](https://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data.htm) and aimed to find similarities among crime occurrences in terms of their time, type and location. A web-based user-interactive dashboard was created usng Plotly Dash and can be viewed below:

Specifically, I created the three sections for the user to explore the following stories:
- **_Initial Exploration_**: What crimes have occurred on a selected date?
- **_Further Exploration_**: For each type of crime, what are the top 5 neighborhoods where it tends to occur? What are its time patterns?
- **_Trendline_**: How has the overall crime condition in Vancouver changed over the years?

## Practiced Skills:
  - Plotly Dash in Python
  - Data Wrangling
  - Storytelling
