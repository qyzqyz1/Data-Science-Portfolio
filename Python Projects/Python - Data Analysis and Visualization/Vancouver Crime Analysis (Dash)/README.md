# Vancouver Crime Data Analysis (Dash)

## Project Description
In this project, I explored Vancouver's public crime dataset from [this link](https://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data.htm) and aimed to find similarities among crime occurrences in terms of their time, type and location. A web-based user-interactive dashboard was created usng Plotly Dash.

To view it online, please check the link below:  

[Dashboard for Vancouver Crime EDA: https://vancouver-crime-dashboard-app.herokuapp.com/](https://vancouver-crime-dashboard-app.herokuapp.com/)

To view it locally, please clone the repository and use the command line to navigate to this folder and run `python app.py`.

Specifically, I created the three sections for the user to explore the following stories:
- **_Initial Exploration_**: What crimes have occurred on a selected date?  
  Sample Output:

- **_Further Exploration_**: For each type of crime, what are the top 5 neighborhoods where it tends to occur? What are its time patterns?   
  Sample Output:

- **_Trendline_**: How has the overall crime condition in Vancouver changed over the years?
