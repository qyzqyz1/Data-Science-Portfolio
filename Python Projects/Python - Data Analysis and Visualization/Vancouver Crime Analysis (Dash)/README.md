# Vancouver Crime Data Analysis

## Project Description
In this project, I explored Vancouver's public crime dataset from [this link](https://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data.htm) and aimed to find similarities among crime occurrences in terms of their time, type and location. I came up with some analytical questions to start with and then developed a set of visualizations to address them.

Specifically, I created the following plots to answer the corresponding question which I see appropriate:
  - Network Graph (*_Python_*): illustrates what major crimes each neighborhood is facing
  - Geographical Graph (*_Plotly/Python_*): demonstrates where each type of crime tends to occur
  - Time Series Graph (*_Plotly/Python_*): shows how various crimes change over time 
  
Since most of my plots are made with Plotly in Python, for a better visual experience please view my [Presentation Slides Here](https://plot.ly/~tomqu/11/analysis-of-crimes-in-vancouver/).

## File Description:
  - **Sample Screenshot**: includes static screenshots of my visualizations
  - **Vancouver Crime Data Analysis.ipynb**: data analysis Python script in .ipynb format
  - **crime.csv**: data from 2003-2017, with coordinates in UTM Zoom 10
  - **crime_csv_all_years.csv**: data from 2003-2019, with coordinates in Latitude and Longitude

## Practiced Skills:
  - Plotly in Python
  - Creating Network Graph
  - Data Wrangling
  - Storytelling
