# Vancouver Crime Data Analysis (Dash)

## Project Description
In this project, I explored Vancouver's public crime dataset from [this link](https://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data.htm) and aimed to find hidden patterns behind crime occurrences in terms of their type, location and time. A web-based user-interactive dashboard was created usng Plotly Dash.

- **To view the dashboard online**, please check the link below:  
[Dashboard for Vancouver Crime EDA: https://vancouver-crime-dashboard-app.herokuapp.com/](https://vancouver-crime-dashboard-app.herokuapp.com/).

- **To view the dashboard locally**, please clone the repository and use the command line to navigate to this folder and run the command `python app.py` and you will be able to view it at http://127.0.0.1:8050/

  _**Note**: the 'Trendline' animation does not function properly while running online for some reason, but this is not a problem while running on the local computer_.

## Dashboard Overview
Specifically, I created three sections/tabs for the user to explore the following stories:
- **_Initial Exploration_**: What crimes have occurred on a selected date?  
  Sample Output:

- **_Further Exploration_**: For each type of crime, what are the top 5 neighborhoods where it tends to occur? What are its time patterns?   
  Sample Output:

- **_Trendline_**: How has the overall crime condition in Vancouver changed over the years?  
  Sample Output:
