# Vancouver Crime Data Analysis (Dash)

## Project Description
In this project, I explored Vancouver's public crime dataset from [this link](https://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data.htm) and aimed to find similarities among crime occurrences in terms of their time, type and location. A web-based user-interactive dashboard was created usng Plotly Dash and can be viewed HERE.

Specifically, I created the three sections for the user to explore the following stories:
- **Initial Exploration**: What were the crimes occured on a selected date
- **Further Exploration**: For each type of crime, what are the top 5 neighborhoods where it tends to occur? What are its time patterns?
- **Trendline**: How has the overall crime condition in Vancouver changed over the years?
  
Since most of my plots are made with Plotly in Python, for a better visual experience please view my [Presentation Slides Here](https://plot.ly/~tomqu/11/analysis-of-crimes-in-vancouver/).

## File Description:
  - **Sample Screenshot**: includes static screenshots of my visualizations
