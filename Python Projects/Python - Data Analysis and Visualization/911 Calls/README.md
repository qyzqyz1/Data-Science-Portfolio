# Exploratory Analysis Project for 911 Calls Data (Python)

## Project Overview
This repository contains python code and dataset for analyzing the 911 Call data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert). 

In this project, I performed some basic exploratory analysis on the dataset to identify the areas in U.S. that would give the most 911 calls and also the top reasons for those calls. I also made several visualization plots through different plotting techniques to explore the relationship between the number of 911 calls received and different time scales (hours in day, months in a year, etc.), categorized by various call reasons.

## Package Requirements
To successfully run the Python script, you need to first install the following libraries in Python by running `pip install "library_name"`:
- **matplotlib** library: Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
- **seaborn** library: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **pandas** library: pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.

## Practiced Skills
- Exploratory Analysis using Python
- Data Manipulation
- Data Visualization
