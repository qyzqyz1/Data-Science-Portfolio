## Deep Learning Micro Projects
- [Implementing MLP](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Deep%20Learning%20Micro%20Projects/Implementing%20MLP.ipynb): Implemented a multi-layer perceptron using backpropagation algorithm on the MNIST image dataset in PyTorch.  

- [Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Deep%20Learning%20Micro%20Projects/Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb): Trained a CNN model on the MNIST dataset, as well as implemented a pre-trained CNN model as feature extractors on classifying flower images.  

- [Recurrent Neural Network](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Deep%20Learning%20Micro%20Projects/Recurrent_Neural_Network.ipynb): Monitored the performance changes of the LSTM network under modifications of hidden layer numbers, learning rates, and number of training epoches.  

- [SGD and Regularization](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Deep%20Learning%20Micro%20Projects/SGD%20and%20Regularization.ipynb): Applied Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the learning algorithms while tuning the SGD parameters to observe the corresponding performance changes.
