  _Natural language processing micro projects were completed along the way when I was taking the ["NLP - Natural Language Processing with Python"](https://www.udemy.com/nlp-natural-language-processing-with-python/) on Udemy. Proof of completion can be viewed [here](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Journey%20to%20Data%20Scientist/Learning%20Certificates/Udemy_NLP_with_Python.pdf)_.
