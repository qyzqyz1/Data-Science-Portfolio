## Apache Spark Python Micro Projects

- [Spark ML with Linear Regression](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Apache%20Spark%20ML%20Micro%20Projects/Linear_Regression_Consulting_Project.ipynb): Built a linear preditive model to help Hyundai Heavy Industries estimate how many crew members a ship will require. 
- [Spark ML with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Apache%20Spark%20ML%20Micro%20Projects/Logistic_Regression_Consulting_Project.ipynb): Created a logistic regression model that will help a market agency classify whether or not a future customer will churn and them an account manager.
- [Spark ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Apache%20Spark%20ML%20Micro%20Projects/Tree_Methods_Consulting_Project.ipynb): Implemented a random forest method to help a dog food company test out which chemical causes the early spoiling by finding out which parameter has the most predictive power.
- [Spark ML with K-means Clustering](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Apache%20Spark%20ML%20Micro%20Projects/Clustering_Consulting_Project.ipynb): Compared results from K-means clustering with two different k-values to help a technology company determine the potential number of hackers.
- [Spark Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Apache%20Spark%20ML%20Micro%20Projects/Natural_Language_Processing_Project.ipynb): Built a spam filter by using various NLP tools with an implementation of a pipeline and also a Naive Bayes classifier.
		
	_Apache Spark Python ML micro projects were completed along the way when I was taking the ["Spark and Python for Big Data with PySpark"](https://www.udemy.com/spark-and-python-for-big-data-with-pyspark/) on Udemy. Proof of completion can be viewed [here](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Journey%20to%20Data%20Scientist/Learning%20Certificates/Udemy_Spark_with_Python.pdf)_.
