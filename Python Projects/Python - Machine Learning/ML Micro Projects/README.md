## Micro Projects: 

- [ML with Linear Regression](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb): Applied Linear Regression to determine whether the company's mobile app or its website would bring greater profits in the future. 
- [ML with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb): Applied Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user would click an ad or not.
- [ML with K Nearest Neighbours](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/ML%20Micro%20Projects/ML%20with%20K%20Nearest%20Neighbors.ipynb): Applied KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while determining the best value for K using the elbow method.
- [ML with Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/ML%20Micro%20Projects/ML%20with%20Support%20Vector%20Machines.ipynb): Applied SVM and parameter tuning technique to classify flowers from the famous iris dataset into different categories.
- [ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests.ipynb): Compared Decision Trees and Random Forests in their predictions of whether a lender will pay off their loans. Used publically available data from LendingClub.com.
- [Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Recommender%20Systems%20with%20Python.ipynb): Built a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities. 
- [Text Analysis with NLTK](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Text%20Analysis%20with%20NLTK.ipynb): Performed feature analysis on the news data, including finding words frequency, removing stopwords, finding n-grams, and creating a WordCloud.
		
	_Python ML micro projects were completed along the way when I was taking the ["Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview) on Udemy. Proof of completion can be viewed [here](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Journey%20to%20Data%20Scientist/Learning%20Certificates/Udemy_Python_Bootcamp.pdf)_.
