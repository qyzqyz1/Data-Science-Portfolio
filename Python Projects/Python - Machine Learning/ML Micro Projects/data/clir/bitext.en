$10,000 Gold?
SAN FRANCISCO – It has never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold.
Wouldn’t you know it?
But January 1980 was arguably a “freak peak” during a period of heightened geo-political instability.
One answer, of course, is a complete collapse of the US dollar.
Yes, gold has had a great run, but so, too, did worldwide housing prices until a couple of years ago.
Instead, the European Union needs a new direction.
Precedents exist for this.
NATO has been flexible since its inception.
Countries that want to integrate further can do so.
I am not talking about a two‑speed Europe.
But influence is not an end in itself - it is a means to an end.
The need for immediate action is clear.
The eurozone’s economy contracted in the last three months of 2011; even Germany’s shrank.
France is flat-lining (as is Britain).
So they should maintain investment in skills and infrastructure, while cutting subsidies and transfer payments.
Indeed, such hopes were misplaced.
For these analyses are hardly neutral, but unwittingly enter an ongoing confrontation.
But it also should not be equated with the political Islamism that strives to capitalize on it.
This cultural debate is not limited to the Arab scene.
When Egon Bahr formulated his Ostpolitik in the 1960’s, no one asked Will Brandt whether Germany was lost.
God bestowed upon Turkey a geographical position that fundamentally requires for us to engage with East and West, North and South.
The symbol of the Byzantine and the Selçuk Empires, which occupied roughly the same geography that Turkey does today, was a double-headed eagle looking both east and west.
In Roman mythology, Janus was the god of gates, doorways, beginnings, and endings.
Theoretical studies suggest that inflation in the accession countries will remain stubbornly higher than the Maastricht Treaty allows.
1929 or 1989?
One senses something like the making of an American-Asian dominated universe.
2011: My Space Odyssey
A few years ago, however, I started paying attention to space again.
Meanwhile, in about 2005, I was in South Africa with a small group advising former President Thabo Mbeki and his government about its IT policy.
Once it was dark, a screen was set up and Mark showed home videos from space.
The kids loved it, and I'm sure some of them decided then and there to study math and science.
Eventually, I invested in Space Adventures, the company that organized Shuttleworth’s trip into space.
Soon after, I started casually discussing the notion of becoming a backup cosmonaut with the Space Adventures team.
Space Adventures was pushing for 2009, but I was pretty busy.
Then something happened last spring: my sister Emily discovered that she had cancer and had a double mastectomy.
(She is doing well now and, in fact, just won a mini-marathon.)
Five years after the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, “9/11” is no longer a mere date.
Most of these changes were embodied in the so-called “USA Patriot Act.”
For everyone else, a kind of state of emergency was proclaimed that has allowed state interference in essential civil rights.
Controls at borders have become an ordeal for many, and police persecution now burdens quite a few.
This stance, however, has not prevented the spread of something for which a German word is used in other languages, too: Angst .
A diffuse anxiety is gaining ground.
Two steps, above all, are needed to restore confidence in liberty within the democracies affected by the legacy of 9/11.
The Eastern Partnership does not offer any quick remedies to the crisis.
But this, of course, is untrue.
The Eastern Partnership is not an answer to all the problems and difficulties that the six partners are facing.
A “Third Way” for Confronting Russia
China is; you are not.”
At the Cold War’s end, Japan remained obsessed with Russia as the heir to the Soviet Union.
What do we keep?”
These principles are clear.
This has been said many times, but repetition does not diminish its importance.
Russia without Ukraine is a manageable nation-state; Russia with Ukraine is an unmanageable empire.
After all, this is Europe more than six decades after World War II, and nearly 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
In Britain, in particular, the spectacular surge of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) can only strengthen the government's long-standing latent Euroskepticism.
Both figures are, again, the lowest in the EU.
A Balanced EU Constitution
EU Commission President Romano Prodi has proposed a scheme to strengthen the Union's executive.
But what is the right level?
So certain services should be allocated to a broader geographic unit because they have externalities (that is, interdependence of effects).
It would be absurd if New York pursued a different foreign policy than Texas.
Much the same is true in Europe.
2. European-level institutions should guarantee the functioning of markets, including competition, commercial, and monetary policies;

Europe faces an historic opportunity.
A Banking Union Baby Step
But their resistance to recognizing problems at home runs even deeper.
Until recently, the Spanish authorities maintained that the problems in their country’s real-estate sector were temporary.
In the case of Ireland, the situation was initially not much different.
But reality has shown that this approach is not tenable.
Given that financial integration is particularly strong within the monetary union, putting the ECB in charge was an obvious choice.
Consider the case of a bank headquartered in Italy, but with an important subsidiary in Germany.
The parent bank would like to use these funds to reinforce the group’s liquidity.
Officially, this has not yet been acknowledged.
This incremental approach has worked well in the past; indeed, today’s European Union resulted from it.
A Berlin Consensus?
A change of mindset is needed not just in the West, but also in the East.
In 1987, the historian Ray Huang explained it for China:
The INET conference in Berlin showed the need for a new one – a consensus that supports sacrifice in the interest of unity.
To many, myself included, NATO's enlargement to take in, among others, the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- which were once Soviet republics -- is an impossible dream come true.
Indeed, enlargement of NATO comes only a few days after a deal was struck between Russia and the EU on the tricky question of access to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.
This small piece of Russia, with 1 million inhabitants and bordering on the Baltic Sea, is squeezed between Poland and Lithuania, two future members of the EU.
Kaliningrad could be a litmus test of these relations.
Only a few years ago EU and NATO enlargement were regarded as wild dreams.
Fortunately, there is a multilateral option and an existing precedent.
This deal could then be given teeth by the UN Security Council.
Russia indicates that it is willing to provide such fuel services.
It is not too late to learn the lessons of the misadventures of A. Q. Khan.
A Big Chance for Small Farmers
It’s a vicious circle, technically known as a poverty trap.
A Black and White Question
That, too, would not have been unusual.
In this instance, it is impossible to pry them apart.
Loved your [television] series—check with you later!’”
Gates might even be planning a television documentary on racial profiling.
Indeed, we don’t even know for certain whether this was such an instance.
A Bollywood Bride for Sarkozy?
If that is true, then Sarkozy missed the romantic opportunity of a lifetime.
Bruni’s own life path closely resembles any number of Bollywood stars who have made the transition from model to actress.
Kissing and fondling in public, even by spouses, is taboo.
In this respect, India more resembles the France with which Sarkozy wants to make a clean break than the current one.
Sarkozy, of all people, should know that a large part of the gravitas of office derives from pomp and circumstance.
And if it’s too late for the wedding, there’s always the reception.
A Bomb in Every Reactor
The answer, ultimately, doesn’t lie with any civilian use of nuclear energy, but first and foremost with its military applications.
Of course, the NPT has repeatedly been violated or circumvented by states that never subscribed to it.
A Born-Again CAP
The CAP must be born again.
The CAP quickly came to be seen as the jewel in the crown of the European project.
Those figures were for an EU of 15 countries, so with today’s 27 members the possibilities are even greater.
The development of an Agricultural Main Structure would compliment the European Ecological Main Structure.
The rhetoric applied to Israel becomes ever more extreme, and conducive to hatred.
Hamas was never mentioned in either of the university unions’ motions.
A Breakthrough Against Hunger
The result is a grain yield (for example, maize) that is roughly one-third less than what could be achieved with better farm inputs.
African farmers produce roughly one ton of grain per hectare, compared with more than four tons per hectare in China, where farmers use fertilizers heavily.
These centers are not household names, but they deserve to be.
Thomas Jefferson compared knowledge to candles: when one is used to light another, it does not diminish the light of the first.
On the contrary, everything becomes brighter.
The Prize Fund for HIV/AIDS Act, a congressional bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, is just such an initiative.
For America, the Sanders bill marks important progress.
A Centerless Euro Cannot Hold
Instead, Portuguese workers are fleeing to booming former colonies such as Brazil and Macau.
This claim was hugely misguided.
Indeed, more than 20 years on, Western Germans still see no end in sight for the bills from German unification.
Later, Maurice Obstfeld pointed out that, in addition to fiscal transfers, a currency union needs clearly defined rules for the lender of last resort.
A Century of Chinese Protests
A Civilization in Crisis
These are all very important issues.
Such a basis is not hard to find.
A Clockwork Chemistry
This scene remains shocking, but, like most science fiction, it has aged.
Science fiction ages fast, but it has a long afterlife.
A Clockwork Orange was accused of glorifying violence, and some of its scenes are still hard to watch.
Science fiction sometimes limits rather than expands our sense of what is possible.
And those who, like the psychopathic Alex, need the most help are probably those who would want it least.
These are, of course, hypothetical questions.
And even if “moral pills” are just science fiction, they raise deep questions.
Will we want to take them if they ever become available?
And what does it say about us if we won’t?
A Cloud over Airplane Safety
The British economy lost £1.5 billion, and others were similarly affected.
Flower growers in Kenya, who depend on air transport to take their short-lived product to Europe, suddenly had no income.
Some 3,000 people die on the world’s roads every day.
In Mill’s view, we are justified in stopping him only to make sure that he is aware of the danger.
Air safety is slightly different, because a crashing plane can kill people on the ground, but the greatest risks by far are borne by the passengers and crew.
A Communist Party without Communism
According to Gleb Pavlovsky, the Putin regime’s leading ideologist, the current Russian system is perfect in all respects but one: it doesn’t know its enemies.
Russia’s economy is more dependent on gas and oil than ever before.
Under Putin, the security service has had its revenge.
But if your instincts betray you, you go back to even deeper ones.
A Confederal Solution for Palestine
LONDON – Last month, while in New York City, I happened to be staying in the same hotel as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
To accommodate his security needs, the hotel had been converted into a fortress, much like Israel itself.
A negotiated “land for peace” solution still remains official Western doctrine.
Israeli Jews are bound to stay in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israeli Arabs are bound to stay in Israel proper.
But that doesn’t mean that it won’t work, at least for a time.
A Confederation for Kosovo
Time is running out in Kosovo.
But Serbia claims that the province remains an essential part of its historical and cultural tradition.
Kosovo would thus gain some essential trappings of statehood.
There are some major themes.
Many citizens believe, rightly, that their mass media are failing to investigate and document abuses.
Hence their impulse to believe in unseen forces.
Sopuissant a Caesar must be above reproach.
Only an imperial Russia, however, would dare reabsorb Ukraine.
With EU expansion coming next spring, all Ukrainians fear that a new wall will cut their country off from the Union's easternmost border in Poland.
The EU should not fret about interfering in Ukraine's domestic affairs.
As the Stern report points out, as usual, the poor are the most vulnerable.

We have but one planet, and should treasure it.
Global warming is a risk that we simply cannot afford to ignore anymore.
A Crisis in Two Narratives
In the medium term, once growth revives, debt can be paid down and the financial sector curbed so that it does not inflict another crisis on the world.
The second narrative starts with the 1950’s and 1960’s, an era of rapid growth in the West and Japan.
Faith in Keynesian stimulus diminished, though high inflation did reduce public-debt levels.
People understand better than the government what they need and are acting accordingly.
Without mutual trust, economic activity is severely constrained.
In the United States, there is now a more systematic, independent survey promoted by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Fortunately, the latest survey, published in July this year, shows that trust in banks and bankers has begun to recover, and quite sharply.
This has been positive for the stock market.
All these data are at an aggregate level and reflect average views among voters and investors.
Why did it worsen?
Economists did not predict that event, either.
The new vanguard includes councils in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, and Canada.
Of course, fiscal councils by themselves are not enough, no matter how well designed they are.
A Customs Union for the Balkans
Yugoslavia has disintegrated, but the disintegration is incomplete.
A host of problems remain unresolved: relations between Serbia and Montenegro and the status of Kosovo (not to mention Serbia’s northern province of Vojvodina).
It was enshrined in the Stability Pact signed at the Sarajevo Summit of July, 1999.
But the Stability Pact is merely a shell – it needs to be filled with content.
The time to do so is at the Zagreb Conference on November 24 called by France as the current EU president.
This will take some time to implement.
The area covered by this plan would include Bulgaria, Croatia and Albania as well as Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo.
Participation by Romania and Moldova is optional.
The Deutsche Mark, already widely used in the region, now functions as the de facto common currency.
But that process has a long way to go.
If the French Presidency fails to seize the moment in Zagreb, an historic opportunity will be lost.
A Czech Moment
The reality is that there is no such thing as “old and new” Europe, and there never was.
On October 24, you can stand up against this injustice.
October 24 is 350 Day.
It is a measure of the seriousness of our problem that CO2 is already at 386 ppm, and is rising by two ppm each year.
The melting of arctic ice is one example.
This year, commercial vessels successfully navigated the Northeast Passage.
They are themselves a cause of further warming: ice and snow reflect the sun’s rays.
There will be climbers hanging banners high in the Himalayas, where the glaciers are melting, and scuba divers at Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, which is threatened by climate change.
A Day of Liberation
From a child’s perspective, it wasn’t self-evident that losing was a good thing.
In today’s Germany, an overwhelming majority subscribes to the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation – not only for Europe, but also for Germany itself.
Compared to public opinion in 1960, that’s certainly an enormous progress.
This is what the term “politics of memory” is meant to indicate.
Far-right groups infamously dubbed the attack by which at least 30,000 people were killed “Dresden’s Holocaust of bombs.”
However, it is sometimes repressed that the massive use of force had been necessary to achieve that result.
Left-wing pacifism tends to overlook this simple fact.
There is yet another lesson to be learned.
Yes, 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation to which the Soviet army contributed decisively.
Will this spell doom for developing countries?
Growth in the developing world tends to come in three distinct variants.
First comes growth driven by foreign borrowing.
Third is growth led by economic restructuring and diversification into new products. 
One such implication is that developing countries will have to substitute real industrial policies for those that operate through the exchange rate.
A Decade of Hugo Chávez
It wasn’t Switzerland, but, by anyone’s measure, it was a genuine democracy.
Not anymore.
Though the Chávez revolution has made progress against poverty and inequality, it is hardly sustainable and reeks of patronage.
A Declaration of Independence from the US
The list goes on and on.
A Democratic Burma?
TOKYO – Historic transformations often happen when least expected.
A Democratic Windfall for Turkey?
They chose to defer to the civilian leadership and to parliament, which, in voting down the US plan, reflected overwhelming public sentiment against the war.
The outcome was a victory for Turkish democracy and recognized as such internationally.
CAMBRIDGE – This year is likely to mark a make-or-break ordeal for the euro.
From 1996 to 2010, unit labor costs in Germany increased by just 8%, and by 13% in France.
Does addressing these imbalances require breaking up the eurozone?
Indeed, French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s government just announced one.
A Dim Light on Global Warming
Many contend that the agenda is being driven by knuckle-dragging climate-change deniers.
A tax on carbon should be equivalent to its damage.
The reason is that monetary cost is only one factor.
Or they believe that their light is “funny.”
You might imagine that people could choose the right light bulbs for themselves.
As US Energy Secretary Steven Chu put it recently, “We are taking away a choice that continues to let people waste their own money.”
And where does this end?
A number of worrying factors about the US economy have been around for a long time:
Today, these deficits set new records by the month;
As the old saying goes: Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
The Bush Administration not only counted its chickens, it sold them forward!
Here's a plausible scenario.
But America today appears less safe.
At that point, Americans will join the stampede out of their economy.
They're free to choose where to put their money.
But this scenario offers no happy ending for Europe.
A Double-Dip Recession for the US?
The American stock market fell 15-20% below its winter levels.
The short-term interest rates it controlled didn't budge.
The informal and unofficial rationale leaking out of the Fed for its inaction had two parts.
It was destroyed by the inflation of the Vietnam era and the oil-price shocks of the 1970s.
This second era now appears to have been as fleeting as the first.
A Dutch Treat for Brazil?
But a better example may be Wim Kok, who stepped down last year after eight years as Dutch Prime Minister.
A Europe for All
Anyone who lives within the European continent cannot – indeed, must not – be considered a stranger to its Union.
Are they not united with those who stood alongside General de Gaulle in the French Resistance?
We know that our part in that great edifice will not be built overnight.
But, like the Union itself, it will be built and it will be done.
A Europe of Provinces, Not States
Communism's fall saw the appearance of several small states in Europe.
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania reemerged from Soviet occupation.
Czechoslovakia split into two separate states.
The difference between Czechoslovakia and Italy or Germany is mostly one of 50 years.
After all, wasn't Italy, until 1860s, a collection of kingdoms and principalities?
Wasn't Germany's unification a matter of ``blood and iron''?
It is only as anadditional level of government that the EU appears onerous and bureaucratic.
Could a federal Europe replace today's national identities?
But what if common European institutions are not viewed through the prism of national institutions?
A Europe of Women?
PARIS – Are women in Europe on the verge of becoming an engine for political change?
Of course, women’s changing status may not translate immediately into growing political influence.
A European Cure for Balkan Depression
But how will Sarajevo look in five years?
The future promises peace without development.
Indeed, it is striking that the majority of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina believe that their leaders are not interested in their country joining the EU.
Stability alone can no longer be the EU’s only objective in the region.
But it is now or never for the Balkans.
The reason is simple.
That is the risk today.
The soft patch may be closer to a quagmire.
This is because Cyprus remains a divided island.
A United Nations plan for unification was accepted by the Turkish part.
The Finnish initiative should be given strong support from all European leaders.
If this means putting pressure on some actors within the EU’s own ranks, so be it.
In 25 years, according to Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, China’s emissions could be double those of the US, Europe, and Japan combined.
Why should anyone have a greater entitlement than others to use the earth’s atmosphere?
More rockets and missiles fell on northern Israel in 33 days than hit Britain during all of World War II.
The facile Clausewitzian wisdom that military action ultimately leads to a political solution is no longer convincing.
“Victory” cannot bring peace, simply because there will always be a war after the war.
A Field Guide to Israeli Hawks
Like everything in Israel, the process is more complicated, especially where the hawks are concerned.
Basically, there are two species of Israeli hawks: call one kind ideological and the other strategic.
Ideological hawks usually come from the National-Religious Party and from members of the Likud.
Then there are the strategic hawks.
It is in this context that Sharon's moves should be seen.
He has brought neither.
Sharon's timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption.
A Foreign Policy for New and Old Europe
Watching the news from Iraq, I recall when I was Poland's Prime Minister during the Gulf War in 1991.
September 1939 taught every Pole that military power must be real to be effective.
Intentions don't deter invasions.
As Danish Premier Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently said, ``France and Germany are not in a position to guarantee our country's security.
Most Poles think that Poland's situation is akin to Denmark's.
The EU's foreign policy should be guided by the following goals:
fight terrorism;
prevent local conflict;
promote human rights and democracy;
maintain close cooperation between Europe and the US;
PRAGUE – Weather conditions around the world this summer have provided ample fodder for the global warming debate.
The US used to generate about half its electricity from coal, and roughly 20% from gas.
Adjusted for inflation, gas has not been this cheap for the past 35 years, with the price this year 3-5 times lower than it was in the mid-2000’s.
Biofuels reduce emissions by only ten Mt, and solar panels by a paltry three Mt.
So, what are the likely costs of an extra $500 billion in infrastructure spending over the next two years?
A French Cure for the Resource Curse
Oil, gas, and mining generate billions of dollars per year for governments and companies.
The United States has already passed legislation requiring public disclosure of payments to governments, through the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.
But one way or the other, personalities will prevail over programs.
A Fresh Start for China and Japan?
Edmonton – Chinese President Hu Jintao will make a high-profile visit to Japan from May 6-10, making him the second Chinese head of state ever to travel there.
Hu’s trip is likely follow the example set by Wen.
It was 30 years ago that former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, the father of today’s prime minister, signed a Peace and Friendship Treaty with China.
One problem is the disputed waters of the East China Sea.
Moreover, today’s “warm politics, cool economics” trend is the reverse of the “cold politics, warm economics” pattern under Koizumi.
Does the European Union care?
During the past four years, Latin America attracted an annual average of $61 billion in foreign direct investment, 60% of which went to Brazil and Mexico.
In 2006, Brazil invested $28.2 billion abroad, compared to inflows of $18.8 billion.
In 2006, Italy’s Fiat Group and India’s Tata Motors established a joint venture to make passenger vehicles and engines in India.
This approach may well be the shape of things to come.
After the establishment of the EU-Chile free-trade area, Chilean exports to the EU increased substantially.
But this must be accompanied by measures to keep all Latin American countries on board.
Herbivorous fish are key players on coral reefs.
Corals are formed by a symbiosis between an animal and a one-celled plant.
The animal provides shelter and nutrients for the plant; the plant converts sunlight into energy, which it shares with the animal.
The plant is expelled, and corals turn a brilliant white color.
If temperatures soon return to normal, the partnership can be restored.
These recovery phases enable adaptations to higher temperatures to spread.
Without fish, seaweed dominance will prevent that recovery.
The future of tropical marine ecosystems, and the millions of people whose lives are linked to them, depend on it.
The only certainty is that the future will be defined by scientific progress and innovation, which cannot be known ahead of time.
Fundamentalist radicals cannot provide real solutions to the region’s basic problems.
Roughly 95% of our agriculture is hi-tech.
At the same time, determined and decisive policies must be taken against extremists.
Self-expression is as important as free expression.
I write this in the 88th year of my life, but not because I have learned from experience.
Like King Lear after he lost his kingdom, there is nothing France can do about its lost influence but rage impotently.
They were only exposing the lack of unity that already existed.
This is particularly true when their objective is to establish an "alternative" to American leadership in security policy.
The German acronym for the EU's "common foreign and security policy" is GASP.
A Gazan Education
In February, the German authorities granted me an entrance visa.
Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth, and one of the poorest – 1.5 million of us live on a patch of land about 41 kilometers long and 6-12 kilometers wide.
Universities in Gaza are overcrowded and starved for supplies.
Many subjects are not even taught, and there are few post-graduate programs.
Without the ability to go overseas, we cannot learn.
I have six brothers and three sisters.
That was at the height of the peace process.
Hamas and other armed groups, I know, have launched rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip that have killed civilians in Israeli towns and villages.
It is also destroying my dream to write “Specialist in Bone Medicine” after my name.
Sometimes, I am sorry that I am from Gaza.
We are students, not soldiers.
We are not fighters in this conflict.
Why doesn’t Israel let us go study?
A Gender Divided
In Democratic Republic of Congo, 1,100 women are raped every day.
Think of China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, South Korea, and Turkey.
Educated, pushy mothers make all the difference.
A German Conservative Credo
In Germany today, conservatism was forged in the wake of the Weimar Republic's failures, experiences unknown to Anglo-Saxon conservatives.
The market is merely a tool, not an answer to every human problem.
A German Europe?
LISBON/RIGA – Is the Europe that is emerging from the euro crisis a German one?
In this Europe, the important moves are now sometimes made in Stockholm or Warsaw, not only in Berlin, Paris, or London.
Germany, in foreign policy as well as in economics, can exert decisive leadership in the EU – when it wants to.
In other words, even when France leads, it does not always do so in a constructive way.
But that might not be enough in an EU with more than 500 million citizens.
A German Glimmer in a Global Boom
In 2004, the world economy grew at a rate of 5.1%, the fastest pace in the last 28 years.
However, in the Asian countries, including China, the optimism is unbroken.
The same is true for Eastern Europe, the ex-Soviet states, and Latin America.
Exports increased by 6.2% in 2005 and are expected to increase by 7.4% in 2006.
In fact, all EU countries except Italy and the Netherlands will grow faster.
A Global Agenda for Seven Billion
Prevention as a framework for international cooperation is a second opportunity.
The fourth big opportunity is supporting countries in transition.
Syria is a special concern.
Last but not least is the imperative of working with and for women and young people.  
The Security Council represents what the World War II Allies believed the post-war world would look like and how it should be run.
Weapons of mass destruction – nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons – are just that, and no cause can excuse their use.
Of course, such a convention will not prevent all future acts of terrorism.
But ideas matter.
Terrorism needs to be de-legitimized in the way that slavery has been.
But this would be a devastating mistake of immediate, as well as inter-generational, proportions.
A Global Perfect Storm
Indeed, the global economy in 2013 could be a very difficult environment in which to find shelter.
Batten down the hatches.
A technological breakthrough – the steam engine, computers, the Internet – may play a leading role.
Visionaries, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Nelson Mandela, may inspire a demand for justice.
Political leaders may lead a broad reform movement, as with Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal.
The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network is a powerful effort to mobilize global knowledge to save the planet.
But time is running very short.
In the post-2015 era, the fight against poverty and the fight to protect the environment will go hand in hand, reinforcing each other.
If anyone is “pushing down on the Italian growth brake” it is Berlusconi himself.
Only consumption is lagging.
A hike, in other words, would indicate that good things are happening.
A Grand Bargain with Iran
The America-Iran-Israel triangle is where the clue to the problem and its possible solution lie.
It seems clear that the European Central Bank will be forced to buy far greater quantities of eurozone sovereign (junk) bonds.
Either way, the threat of a profound financial crisis is high.
For the eurozone’s southern periphery, however, today’s euro rate is very difficult to manage.
BUENOS AIRES – Desperate times bring desperate measures.
An Arab Marshall Plan
And the United Arab Emirates recently pledged $2.5 billion to Bahrain.
This calls for redefining relationships not only between citizens and states, but also among Arab countries.
Clearly, the birth of an African human rights court should be celebrated.
Figures for the ICTR are only slightly better.
Moreover, effective courts must be politically independent.
Fifty-four of them were civilians who didn't take part in the fighting, and 25 were under 18 years of age.
A Hundred Years of Superconductivity
This spring marked the 100th anniversary of the discovery of superconductivity – the ability of materials to carry electrical current with no loss.
Because of this property, superconductors have unique features that can be exploited in many ways.
And, when wound into coils, they can produce extremely strong magnetic fields.
Such superconducting magnets have been applied in a variety of technologies.
The best-known examples are the magnets that drive the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines found in most hospitals.
Perhaps the most exotic are the huge magnets used to accelerate particles in the Large Hadron Collider, which seeks to discover the fundamental principles of matter.
Such temperatures can be achieved only through liquid-helium cooling.
As Time magazine proclaimed in May 1987, with the discovery of these so-called “cuprates,” the superconducting revolution had begun.
Alas, the revolution soon bogged down.
This is exacerbated by their strong anisotropy – the materials have a quasi-two-dimensional structure consisting of a weakly coupled stack of conducting sheets.
This brings us to the intellectual challenge of superconductors.
It took 46 years from the discovery of superconductivity to the 1957 Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS) theory of how the phenomenon occurs.
Along the way, a number of famous physicists tried and failed to get the answer – Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, and Richard Feynman being notable examples.
Discovering the solution required the development of advanced theoretical techniques.
How can one pair electrons without ions holding them together, thereby enabling higher-temperature superconductors?
Whatever the theory turns out to be, it is certain to revolutionize physics.
Twenty years after the Cold War’s end, Japan will at last have a post-Cold War system of government.
Unlike in Europe, Japan developed its state before building a strong civil society.
They will most likely succeed.
The Diet’s role was merely pro forma.
Its unemployment rate rose from 1.8% in 1990 to 9.6% in 1994, before bottoming out at 5% in 2001.
Sixteen years after the crisis, the unemployment rate was 6.2% – more than triple the rate in 1990.
Inequality in Korea rose from moderate levels to second highest (behind the US) among advanced OECD countries.
From 1993 to 1998, the US created millions of jobs, which raised the employment rate by 5.4 percentage points.
A long, painful period of high unemployment runs counter to what most experts believed the flexible US economic model would ever produce.
So the lesson from the recession is clear.
Paris, in case anyone had any lingering doubts, remains the capital of the world – or so it seemed for a night.
France is not Imperial Rome, where panem et circenses made a fundamental difference.
According to Hollande, the economic upturn – la reprise – had just started, and hope was around the corner.
His tone and message had changed.
Beyond his message’s wishful thinking, the public’s reaction to the messenger was a mixture of disbelief and indifference.
It was December 31, 1989, and I was in the Soviet Union. I had found myself in a restaurant in the old city of Suzdal, listening to President Mikhail Gorbachev’s “New Year wishes.”
Has Hollande become, in this sense, a French Gorbachev?
For the left and the Greens, he is close to being a traitor.
After a year of Hollande, France is witnessing a fundamental political revolution.
During the half-century of the Fifth Republic, a bipartisan system of left and right has traditionally prevailed.
For the peoples of the Caucasus, Turkey marks our path to Europe.
After all, security alliances and guarantees only create dividing lines, with their attendant security challenges.
The US views an opening to Turkey as a way to decrease Armenia’s real and imagined reliance on Russia.
If this does not happen within the coming weeks and months, then Turkey will have demonstrated that all this was just a show.
A Lasting Poison
Friedrich Nietzsche said that if you look in the eye of the Devil for too long, you risk becoming a devil yourself.
In 2006, the Nobel Prize-winning German author Günter Grass’s disclosed that, 60 years earlier, he was, as a teenager, a member of the Waffen-SS.
If nothing else, in order to forgive, we have to know what we are forgiving.
A League of Democracies?
One cannot imagine India or Brazil wanting to be part of any such a combination.
The UN was created under rules designed to enable states of different political colors to live together.
The world also already has a prosperity-spreading mechanism.
It is called trade.
In 1994, the World Trade Organization was created to liberalize trade under agreed rules.
The second of these unions is composed of Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, and now Zimbabwe, all of which use the South African rand.
To see why, consider Nigeria.
With the establishment of the Central Bank of Nigeria in 1959, the Nigerian pound was introduced.
Government expenditure exceeded federal revenue, despite rapidly rising foreign-exchange earnings from oil exports after 1970.
But that did not happen.
When the West African Monetary Zone finally is established, the number of currencies in Africa will equal about half the number of countries.
Similarly, banks have short-term liabilities (deposits) and long-term assets, which they cannot liquidate quickly without incurring great losses.
Only the ECB can provide this insurance.
In this way, the proper division of labor could be established.
It now needs to be implemented.
The legal obstacles to potential “monetary financing” of the public sector in the European Union’s governing treaties can be overcome.
A Loan and a Prayer
Spanish borrowing costs are also rising.
This can happen in a number of ways.
No one will descend from the heavens, deus ex machina, to bail out the IMF or the EU.
A Long March with China
BEIJING – US Vice President Joe Biden’s recent four-day visit to China ended on a high note.
Even a brawl between the Chinese and a visiting American basketball team is viewed as evidence of China’s aggressive behavior.
Are we going to be in a war?
A Looming Anti-Depressants Crisis
The anti-depressant crisis provides, for the first time, dramatic evidence of the collective value of user reports in understanding drug risk.
A Man against the Machine
If we are still making any progress at all, it is because of the noble efforts of a small number of United States senators.
We do not yet know what combination of black-box computer programs and electronic trading algorithms, interacting across more than 50 market centers, caused this catastrophe.
The SEC was once a great and powerful independent agency.
It fell on hard times in recent decades and is only beginning to get its act together under new leadership.
The amendment was moderate and entirely reasonable, yet it went down to defeat, 33-61, also on May 6.
Family history information was obtained from the patient regarding their immediate relatives.
We have seen evidence of this in our practice.
A Marshall Plan for the Arab World
The crisis in Europe’s southern neighborhood reflects a deep-seated transformation process that will have long-lasting consequences – for the region, for Europe, and for the world.
TOLEDO, SPAIN – This autumn, the Toledo International Centre for Peace convened a meeting devoted to water cooperation in the Middle East.
More is to come.
Dollar/Euro ($/_) 0.88 1.26
Yen/Euro (-/_) 93.1 113.3
Canada has run current account deficits for all but three of the last 50 years; the US has done the same for 30 years.
Do Europe and Japan really want to see the US achieve an external balance?
Second, they existed without any fiscal transfers from a common center, because such a center did not exist.
Hardening Brazil’s Soft Power
It last went to war in 1942, after direct aggression by Nazi U-boats in the South Atlantic.
To be sure, Brazil’s peaceful foreign policy has served it well.
Brazil has used its stature to advance peace and cooperation in South America and beyond.
South America is becoming a region where war is unthinkable – what the political scientist Karl Deutsch once called a “security community.”
The presence of Brazilian peacekeepers in countries like Haiti and Lebanon underscores Brazil’s contribution to maintaining peace and security worldwide.
China Grows Down
With the country fully integrated into global supply chains, TFP growth hit 4%, where it remained until 2007.
A ranking prepared for the City Corporation in London shows New York and London still neck and neck at the top of the league.
That is far harder to judge.
A Murder in Moscow
Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago, the crime was committed in the clear belief that it would please the king.
A human chain was formed, with participants wearing white tops.
My colleagues in the capital, Bogotá, and in the south of the country, where we have humanitarian projects, say that everyone was waving white scarves.
White balloons were launched everywhere.
As is often the case in armed conflicts, civilians suffer the most.
After four hours on a dirt road, I reached a highlands hamlet.
But when I asked five of them what they would like to become, I understood that this conflict has marked them forever.
The fifth one wanted to become a chemist, so that he could set up a cocaine laboratory.
It is perhaps a beginning.
NEW YORK – The past half-century has been the age of electronic mass media.
Television has reshaped society in every corner of the world.
In 1950, fewer than 8% of American households owned a TV; by 1960, 90% had one.
Television and related media have been the greatest purveyors and conveyors of corporate and political propaganda in society.
All roads to power in America lead through TV, and all access to TV depends on big money.
Even war can be rolled out as a new product.
A recent survey in the US by the organization Common Sense Media reveals a paradox, but one that is perfectly understandable.
YEREVAN – Once again, the issue of bombing or sanctioning Iran has resurfaced.
That is why the world must not remain focused on the already-lost first phase.
Comparisons with neighboring Turkey are instructive.
A New Anti-Semitism
Belonging to a particular cultural group is merely a pretext for battles between the winners and losers of globalization.
One would have thought that anti-Semitism died forever with the Holocaust; but it did not.
The more worrisome source of anti-Semitism is different and justifies speaking of a new anti-Semitism.
It has to do with Israel.
Intellectuals like the late Edward Said gave voice to it, but it has many followers in the United States and Europe.
Anti-Semitism is disgusting in whatever form it arises.
It is linked to Israel.
Yet a road map for a peaceful transition can be designed.
This might be done in several ways.
Indeed, investment in Sudan has actually grown $2.8 billion over the last year.
After all, Sudan is the size of Western Europe, and Darfur is the size of France, with 158 refugee camps.
But it is not monolithic.
On the contrary, it has become more rigorous and covert.
More importantly, even the regulators themselves have ceased to believe in obsolete and rigid doctrines.
This has resulted, in the short run, in an embrace of low journalistic standards.
A New Deal for Fragile States
I experienced firsthand the need for a new approach in 2004 in Sri Lanka.
Big mistakes were made, fueling further violence.
After Haiti’s catastrophic earthquake in 2010, the country was dubbed “the republic of NGOs.”
The idea is basic and well known.
Traditional farming uses few inputs and gets poor yields.
If farmers can be helped to obtain simple technologies, income can rise, and they can accumulate bank balances and collateral.
A New Deal for the Lisbon Strategy
Whatever happened to the European Union’s Lisbon Strategy?
At bottom, the problem is one of legitimacy.
Within many states, “power” isn’t politically correct.
In many matters pertaining to the Lisbon Strategy, the EU cannot avoid member states’ concerns.
The combined population of the US, Mexico, and Canada is about 410 million people.
Mexico's President Vincente Fox will govern through 2006.
US citizens register high approval ratings in Canada and Mexico: 90% and 70%, respectively.
Moreover, throughout NAFTA's lifetime income and wealth have been further concentrated within the elite sectors of US and Canadian society.
The people of the US, Canada, and Mexico deserve better.
Russia will hold a presidential election in 2012.
Only under such conditions will difficult problems lend themselves to solution.
Medvedev's decision to suspend construction of a highway through the Khimki forest near Moscow in the face of widespread civic protest was important.
So the struggle between democratic and anti-democratic tendencies is becoming acute.
Among these priorities, one of the most important is education.
Indeed, today’s elite cannot or will not solve the problem.
Society will support him.
A New Era for Islamic Science?
In the other half of the known planet, scientists were punished, even killed.
Now, of course the roles of the Islamic Middle East and the West are reversed.
Would the political rhetoric shift if researchers in Oman discovered a key to suppressing AIDS?
But another exists, and not just for Islamic societies.
Major scientific organizations have protested, without result.
For example, Texas, like most southern US states, was once economically poor and declining.
So Texas decided to devote its oil money to an educational endowment.
A New Holy Alliance?
The first “Holy Alliance” was a creation of Austria’s Prince Metternich following the Napoleonic wars.
Since 2001, Christian minorities have been targeted throughout the region, including even Lebanon’s Maronite Christian community.
Far more needs to be done.
Suppose coal produces electricity at a cost of $0.06 per kilowatt-hour, while solar power costs $0.16/kilowatt-hour.
Here is another way.
The consumer price is raised 10% of the way from $0.06 to $0.16, thus reaching $0.07/kilowatt-hour. 
The consumer price for electricity is now set at $0.11, exactly halfway between $0.06 and $0.16.
Let us presume, finally, that by 2050, all electricity production has made the transition to low-carbon energy sources.
A New Science
Physics, at least the physics we encounter as ordinary humans, is well mapped.
Each discipline has its own language and its own separate machinery.
Consider the brain, for example.
If the FIS group is lucky, there will also be some radical input from thinkers that do not presently have access to first world infrastructure.
Independent thinking is an underestimated factor.
The most creative breakthroughs became famous events.
The group identified the gaps that need explanation.
The main problems are easily identified.
LEU cannot be used to make weapons.
But this can only be a first step.
A New-State Solution for Israel and Palestine
Think about that for a minute.
Indeed, much has been written recently about the ascent of the left in Latin America over the past decade.
A New Velvet Revolution
Four smaller parties, who allied themselves in a four-party coalition called “4K” objected.
TV journalists rebelled, occupying the station's newsroom.
The protests by artists, intellectuals and opposition politicians that followed were the biggest political upheavals since 1989.
But political realignment is not the most important news arising from this turmoil.
A New World Architecture
We used to be reassured by the generalization that democratic countries seek peace.
He believes in international cooperation, rather than the might-is-right philosophy of the Bush-Cheney era.
This form of warfare is especially worrisome for two reasons.
The first shots in this battle have already been fired.
In 2005, we can begin to change direction.
What we learned is easily summarized.
2005 is the year that words can become reality, and that the world can begin to fulfill its hopes for our new millennium.
LONDON: A hundred years ago, the humorous English magazine Punch carried a cartoon which depicted a young and nervous curate eating breakfast with his bishop.
He was eating a boiled egg, and clearly not enjoying it.
The cartoon caught the English fancy, and created a catch-phrase still in use today, although it is usually misunderstood and misused.
This week’s European Summit at Nice (December 7-9) looks like being a curate’s egg.
The question is, will it be bad all through and a failure?
Or will it be “excellent in parts”?
Everyone knows that these changes ought to be radical, even semi-federal.
Even as a conjuring trick, the Charter could be influential.
For example, Article 2 reads: “Everyone has the right to life.
But it could also become the first, essential step on the road to the drafting of a European constitution.
The situation in Libya today is not identical.
But Qaddafi is shrewd.
China and Russia have expressed reservations.
The Arab League has endorsed a similar proposal.
And he cannot be free to make those attacks more lethal by using his airpower.
Begin with first principles.
A Path through Europe’s Minefield
Let me stake out more precisely the narrow path that would allow Europe to pass through this minefield.
A Peace of Water
Fresh water is one such area.
The bad news is that water, unlike land, cannot simply be divided.
Similarly, there is wide agreement that some water currently used by Israelis will have to be allocated to Palestinian use.
Everything else can be worked out.
In such a forum, water and solar energy in tandem could help to move the Middle East from conflict to collaboration.
Water is the essence of life.
A People’s Economics
I recently participated in a panel discussion of this phenomenon at the American Economic Association annual meeting in Denver.
So, why is the public buying more books by professional economists?
Sometimes we need to turn off autopilot and think for ourselves, and when a crisis occurs, use our best human intellect.
There is no established scientific procedure that could prove their validity.
NEW YORK – Where is the American and global economy headed?
One camp argued that the recession in the United States would be V-shaped – short and shallow.
Strauss-Kahn is, of course, likely to be Sarkozy’s Socialist rival in the next French presidential election.
There may now be a market for a Greek translation of her book.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton represented the United States.
Midway through her remarks, she began speaking not to the Syrian ambassador, who was in the room, or even the Syrian government, but directly to the Syrian people.
Here, the pivot to the people includes the American people: the dynamism, creativity, and resources of American business and non-profit organizations already engaged around the world.
A Planet for All Apes
Publicity for the new film claims that it is “the first live-action film in the history of movies to star, and be told from the point of view of, a sentient animal.”
But he also understood the ethical issue.
Herbert Terrace, the Columbia University psychologist who was directing the project, decided to end it and sent Nim back to the primate facility in Oklahoma.
Experiments on great apes are now either banned or severely restricted in New Zealand, Australia, and Japan.
Adjustments will need to be made.
Over the past 20 years, no geo-political space has undergone as dramatic a transformation as that between the Atlantic and the Urals.
Many of these weapons remain deployed or designed for use within the Euro-Atlantic region.
So security vigilance is essential.
These include:
·        further reductions in US and Russian nuclear forces.
The timing could not be better, as the Euro-Atlantic family has entered a critical period.
But it could.
The charges against him have a powerful stigmatizing effect.
A Press Without Principles
The Associated Press refuses to comment on him.
Instead, it has fallen to foreign press organizations to defend him.
In 2003, it was SARS.
For example, they usually find it difficult to jump between species, because they would have to change their structure.
But AIDS jumped from monkeys and several types of flu jumped from swine.
There are more bacteria than any other life form.
Many nerve, respiratory and muscle diseases might also be caused by prions.
Malaria afflicts 300 million people and is the world’s biggest killer of children.
There are also antagonists that are currently ignored.
Environmental chemicals and particulates might warrant their own categories.
Or consider combinations of problems, such as these chemical infectors mixing with airborne pollens, and apparently pushing up incidences of asthma.
New fungal infections are even scarier and might be harder to treat.
In practical terms, how should it be built?
Initial warning signs of a pandemic are most likely to appear in the developing world, but detection nodes should be positioned in every country, with the least possible expense.
Medical infrastructure exists everywhere, in some form.
A small amount of additional scientific expertise and lab equipment would need to be added to a public health system that serves ordinary needs.
Can a public figure have a private life?
Prostitution is illegal in most of the US, including Washington DC, and this could be one reason why Tobias had to resign.
By any sensible measure, Corzine’s violation of the law was more serious than that of Tobias.
A Putin Boom?
Recently, the Moscow brokers Brunswick Warburg predicted that Russia’s GDP will surge 5% this year.
The last real worry was the foreign balance.
A similar deal is likely in the Paris Club for the regulation of debts to governments.
A Race to Hunger
This year, after a particularly bad growing season, we see the results.
We have been here before.
Since 2008, ethanol production has increased by 33%.
The result?
But having the community’s support is not enough.
That is why we are assessing different methods for gathering data from the field, including the use of mobile applications to digitize paper records.
A Recovery for All
This can be achieved.
As a result of the currency peg, Argentina's interest rates were largely determined in the US.
A Referendum For Kurdistan?
But by now it is clear that this is a worthless piece of paper.
After all, the Kurds have, by any internationally accepted standards, a right to self-determination.
The same should apply to Turkey.
Perhaps to assuage political fears - and considerations of international law - any plebiscite in the Kurdish region should, initially, have only a consultative status.
A Referendum on Obama
While the 1988, 1992, and 2000 elections were also quite consequential, the policy shifts were not nearly as large as in 1980 and 2008.
The economy is improving slowly, but it remains in bad shape, with high unemployment and millions having left the labor force.
Finally, the US needs a financial system that serves all of society, rather than operating as if it were an end in itself.
A Reset in the Caucasus
Moreover, there are no entangling alliances complicating the matter.
Georgia is not a NATO member, and the United States, it is clear, will not go to war with Russia over Georgia.
The Armenian-Azerbaijani struggle is more precarious.
Completing the process depends directly and indirectly on how Armenians and Azerbaijan work to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
Endless public sparring between Turkish and Armenian officials through the media is not helping.
What is at stake is the future of a region critical to Eurasia’s peace.
Adding to the swell of voices, November will see the documentary film based on my book ‘Cool It’ released in the US.
A Rio Report Card
Twenty years ago, the world tried to address these realities through treaties and international law.
We have thousands of documents but a failure to speak plainly to one other.
The extremist positions are clear.
Extremist Palestinians vow to fight until Israel--viewed as a colonial imposition on the Islamic world--is destroyed.
For them, Israel's pre-1967 borders, the entire city of Jerusalem, and the West Bank of the Jordan River is land given to the Jewish people by God.
Extremists simply have enough power to undermine a process based on trust alone.
Nor will one side's extremists defeat the other side's extremists.
Roosevelt’s first case, against Northern Securities in 1902, was immensely controversial.
The Kanjorski Amendment is a very big stick.
A Russian Dreyfus Affair
At that time, the French army was licking its wounds from the defeat at Sedan and the creation of Bismarck's imperial Germany.
Today's Russian army is not the bastion of reactionary monarchism and anti-Semitism that shaped French officers' behavior in the Dreyfus affair.
Some officers are all of these, and most are some of them.
A Russian Spring?
PARIS – Russia is not Egypt.
And Moscow is not on the eve of revolution as Cairo was less than a year ago.
And not all Russians are in the streets.
As young Arabs told the rulers of Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Yemen, and other Arab countries, this new generation of Russians is telling Putin: “Get Out!”
For a long time, Russia has perceived itself as a “White Africa.”
The corrupt enrichment of so many Russian elites mimics the disastrous habits of many of their African counterparts.
Its population is exploding, as are its economic-growth rates.
Africa is on the rise, while Russia is on the decline.
A Saudi Asks, \
In our attempts to defend and justify ourselves over the past year, we Saudis learned about the consequences of extremism at Waco, Texas and Oklahoma City.
We wrote about the Michigan Militia and other American radical extremists.
But the Americans studied and analyzed minutely the Waco and Oklahoma City incidents on their own.
Saudi Arabia's population is divided into distinctive regional, tribal, and sectarian groups.
To the east, in the oil-rich province, are the Shia.
The danger in Saudi Arabia is that the IRA are no match for Muslim fundamentalists in their fanaticism.
This is difficult because the ruling al-Saud are themselves divided.
By contrast, the regime itself will be imperiled if it clings to its narrow base.
Thus, an economic policy that tackles America’s debt and deficit makes up the main portion of the Strategy.
A Seismic Crime
L’Aquila was largely destroyed by earthquakes in 1461 and 1703.
The city was rebuilt, eventually grew to more than 73,000 inhabitants, and remained stable for more than 300 years – until October 2008, when tremors began again.
On April 6, 2009, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck L’Aquila and nearby towns, killing more than 300 people and injuring more than 1,500.
In February 2011, almost 200 people died when a 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck Christchurch, New Zealand.
The Big One will one day strike California.
The concept is simple.
But one aspect of this shining story is tarnished.
The Golden Rice story makes it clear that we do not yet have the will and the wisdom to make that happen.
CHICAGO – How will the eurozone crisis play out in the next few weeks?
As for the birthplace of the euro crisis, Greece’s debt will almost surely have to be restructured.
A Star is Jailed
The Philippines is not a country used to seeing powerful people punished.
My sometime co-author Carmen Reinhart makes the same point, perhaps even more clearly.
It remains a good idea today.
Germany cannot carry the euro on its shoulders alone indefinitely.
There is no safe path forward.
This should be increasingly true as high-rise condominiums become more common.
In some cases 100 homes can, in effect, be stacked on one another.
A Sustainable Recovery
What kinds of power plants will be acceptable in the future?
Will they be allowed to emit carbon dioxide as in the past?
That is largely the job of government.
The US is not the only economy in this equation.
The US auto industry should be re-tooled for low-carbon-emission automobiles, either plug-in hybrids or pure battery-operated vehicles.
This will have to change. 
This time we will need global cooperation.
These large-scale changes will have to be coordinated, at least informally if not tightly, among the major economies.
Little wonder, then, that few Americans believe that what walks like a duck and quacks like a duck is actually the phoenix of recovery.
From Mississippi to Maine, and from New York to New Orleans, America’s written language is the same and the spoken language is understandable to all.
Not so from Berlin to Barcelona or Rome to Rotterdam.
(Or, for that matter, from northern to southern China or in multilingual India, where Hindi is spoken by only 42% of the population.)
And it can survive.
A Tale of Two Defaults
Initially, the new arrangement worked very well.
But, after about 10 years, the success story turned bitter.
In that case, the Greek government’s debt to its eurozone partners would be equivalent to 400% of its GDP, very little of which would be repaid.
Karl Marx famously wrote that history repeats itself as farce.
A Tale of Two Dictatorships
Now, it is moving into Pakistan and West Asia.
One sight at LUMS, a leading private university in Lahore, heartened me: how women were dressed.
There has also been an explosion of free media in Pakistan.
But to what avail?
Myanmar has effectively isolated itself for more than 50 years.
What can even more isolation achieve?
But turnout for these elections has been falling in several countries.
This has spread a sense of unfairness.
But there is another reason for the lack of interest in the EU elections.
There will be no such entity, because there is no European electorate; the electorate remains French, Belgian, Latvian, Greek, and so on.
But what does an Italian know – or care, for that matter – about British politics?
A Tale of Two Terminals
On the other side of the globe, Terminal 3 in Beijing, which opened for full operations just one day before Terminal 5, has been operating almost without a glitch.
While T5 will mostly service British Airways, T3 will service Air China and two dozen other airlines. 
A Thai Spring?
With 47 million voters and turnout at 75%, Thailand’s latest election results pose a decisive challenge to the country’s long-established regime.
The return to power of Pheu Thai is extraordinary – and not only because Yingluck will be Thailand’s first female prime minister.
In the second half of the twentieth century, Thai elections seemed to alternate with military coups.
The rise of Thaksin’s Thai Rak Thai party in 2001 changed all that.
The voices of neglected swaths of the electorate, particularly in the rural north and northeast of the country, began to count.
A bond between party and voters – a bond based on policy – took root.
Some see this change as usurpation; others view it as Thailand’s deliverance into the twenty-first century.
A Theory of European Citizenship
Venetians became Italians, Bavarians became Germans, and so on.
Clearly, people in the real world do not ordinarily get to choose the basic structure of their society.
Obviously, you will not choose rules that define citizenship in terms of a particular cultural identity.
A Thousand to One
It is as if the government had brought back an Israeli who had been sent to Mars.
A Time of Tests
LONDON – This is a tough time to be a decision-maker.
We live in an era of low predictability.
The world appears in constant flux.
A Time to Build
But the balance of risks has shifted over the past few years.
So, too, does private sector involvement.
The Nobel laureate economist William Vickrey argued tirelessly in favor of privately financed toll roads.
Even China, which has added more than 50,000 kilometers of roads and dozens of airports over the past five years, makes use of private financing.
The IMF is absolutely right to remind ministers each April of downside risks.
The current financial crisis is different from all the others we have experienced since World War II.
But the controversy threatens to disrupt the April 2 meeting.
That is in the common interest.
The mechanism exists and has already been used on a small scale.
Here is a list of things to watch for.
Will Europe get its act together?
And banks – whether explicitly nationalized or not – will be under pressure to prioritize domestic borrowers.
They need to come to grips with the reality that national regulations and international markets are inextricably linked with – and in need of – each other.
The flow of workers out of employment exceeds the flow back into employment.
In North America, governments appear to have muddled through.
In May, the world will mark the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe.
The heads of state of all three countries have been invited to participate in the parades to be held in Moscow to celebrate the Red Army’s victory over Nazi Germany.
Of course, the USSR instigated the war in tandem with Adolf Hitler, but its responsibility is undeniable.
A Tribute to James Wolfensohn
As World Bank president, Wolfensohn argued consistently that the world cannot be divided into “haves” and “have-nots.”
Poverty anywhere means poverty everywhere, and equitable growth is needed for the stability and security of all.
This agenda goes to the heart of improving human dignity and maintaining sustainable development.
Indeed, outspokenness was a hallmark of Wolfensohn’s tenure.
The IMF has not been immune to this treatment.
Ultimately, development is about people.
A Triumph for “Old Europe”
After all, who would have predicted a World Cup final between France and Italy?
The program was in English, but the advertisements were in Spanish.
In a world of “multiple identities,” to choose one’s team is in part to decide who one is.
Reality is more complex.
And now we are back to reality.
A Turning Point for Europe\u0027s Constitution
Given Europe's political heterogeneity, the European Parliament is unlikely to be ruled by a single-party majority.
But delegates to the Convention should not stop there.
This is how the US gradually evolved into a presidential democracy, towards the mid-19th century.
Xi in Russia
Is that slogan more valid now?
A few deals to export Russian hydrocarbons to China can be expected, but not much more.
Many more Chinese lived in the Russian Empire before the 1917 revolution.
To do so, capital and technology will be needed not only from China, but also from Japan, South Korea, the US, and Southeast Asian countries.
Over the years Israeli governments encouraged Arabs to participate in Israel's economy.
Having secured an independent Irish state, Catholics in the Republic of Ireland came to accept the existence of a settler enclave in Northern Ireland.
But, the Irish story has not had a happy ending.

Each should be tackled.
The ambassadors showed courage.

MELBOURNE – Scholars have long dreamed of a universal library containing everything that has ever been written.
And the library could include not only books and articles, but also paintings, music, films, and every other form of creative expression that can be captured in digital form.
But Google’s plan had a catch.
Most of the works held by those research libraries are still in copyright.
Chin held that the United States Congress, not a court, was the appropriate body to decide who should be entrusted with guardianship over orphan books, and on what terms.
This vast collection of knowledge, culture, and literary achievement is inaccessible to most people.
Digitizing it would make it available to anyone with Internet access.
A Universal Revolution
They do not derive from a social contract.
Indeed, they are part of what makes us human.
Each of us may enjoy rights.
By the end of the decade, many Soviet bloc regimes had collapsed. 
Other governments and intergovernmental bodies have not filled the gap left by the US.
Europe, by contrast, is clearly lagging.
First, Europe’s geology is different from that of America.
Licensing and regulation of exploration and production are decided at the national level.
But the most crucial – and almost always overlooked – point about fracking is that shale gas, like all hydrocarbons, can be used only once.
BUDAPEST – In the discussions now underway in Copenhagen, the fate of Earth’s climate is at stake.
But it will not.
Can We Feed the World?
In one area of Kenya, farmers who had to travel 17 kilometers to reach an agrodealer in 2004 had to travel only four kilometers three years later.
As a result, the proportion of people living in poverty fell from 51% in 1991-92 to 28.5% in 2005-06.
Less of an Ass
The practice was widely known as “libel tourism.”
The cases involving science included a costly lawsuit against Nature, one of the world’s best-known and most widely respected scientific journals.
Apparently, 23 copies of the book were sold in the United Kingdom.
But the standard that must be met has been changed.
Consider the historic events that have taken place in the past year and the role played by the United States and Europe.
They will not negotiate a separate peace.
In the 60 years since World War II came to an end, we have counted on each other in times of peril and challenge.
That unity need not mean a uniformity of tactics or views, but rather a union of purpose.
Zimbabwe’s president, Robert Mugabe, loves elections.
When my party started eleven years ago, we called ourselves the Movement For Justice.
This is where the battle lines are now drawn, and where the future of the country will be decided.
The problem has been that because we have lacked an independent judiciary, we have not had an independent election commission.
Winston Churchill once said, “War is too serious a business for generals.”
In the United States, it should be remembered, the need for a fiscal stimulus developed, so it seems, out of the blue.
His latest provocation is a short film denouncing Islam, which is yet to be shown, but has already caused panic all around.
Brussels, the capital of the European Union, stands for everything populists, whether left or right, hate.
Both positions are hopelessly buried in intellectual and moral fog.
From the legal point of view, it makes no difference whether the accused is a sitting or former head of state.
In this case, justice comes with poisoned arrows.
International law is the conscience of mankind.
But the perception that the law is selectively applied happens to be true.
The charge of selective application also applies to the Bashir warrant.
Its fiscal weakness limits its ability to act as global policeman.
If not, stay out.
The War of 1812 and the Civil War are clear examples.
Had the Axis’s negative watershed succeeded, the US would have become a far different country.
But the risk that weapons of mass destruction could be turned against the US makes it so.
A Way out of Tibet’s Morass
Many carried the forbidden Tibetan national flag, suggesting that they think of Tibet as a separate country in the past, and in about 20 incidents government offices were burned down.
A Weak Start for START
Nonetheless, New START marks a step in the direction of disarmament.
A Window of Opportunity for European Defense
The Saint Malo Declaration signaled that the EU’s leading military powers were prepared to develop their own defense policy, though one not fully autonomous of NATO.
NEW YORK – The world is at a crossroads.
The World Bank was established in 1944 to promote economic development, and virtually every country is now a member.
With the Bank just two blocks away from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, it has been all too easy for the US to dominate the institution.
More recently, the Bank has increased its support for smallholders, but there is still far more that it can and should do.
A World of Convergence
This “divergence” was very pronounced in colonial times.
A World of Multiple Reserve Currencies
The only question is which national currency will capture the role.
The dollar and the pound then shared international primacy in the 1920’s and 1930’s.
Today, currencies other than the dollar account for 40% of identified international reserves.
There will be an international market for all three.
A World of Regions
Europe has not solved the problem of balancing the interests of strong economies in the North and those of weaker economies in the South.
It has provided the institutional framework for reuniting Western and Eastern Europe.
The age of colonialism is finished, and we are now moving beyond the age of US global dominance.
The rest of the speech was even more revealing, though it drew little public notice.
We are, in short, moving to a multi-polar world.
Of course, this should occur in a context of cooperation across regions as well as within them.
Greed was just taking a temporary break.
But the 1972 ABM Treaty prohibits, for the indefinite future, systems to protect either country against such nuclear attack.
Russia’s early "nyet" may not be the last word.
So political turmoil with Russia and Europe might be calmed.
ALBERTA – As China enters the “Year of the Ox,” there is much to reflect on from the past 12 months and even more to speculate about regarding the coming year.
It is also bad news for America and China.
It worked.
Just 27% chose America.
The Obama administration has already moved against Chinese exports of tires and steel pipes, but this year’s confrontation will extend well beyond trade.
A full-scale trade war is unlikely.
The massive tax claims against Yukos used for this purpose were precisely that – the means rather than the end.
The ADB argues that other agencies are responsible for social development.
Abba Eban: The Voice of Israel
His scholarly training and rhetorical gifts supplemented each other in a rare fashion.
In short, he was a modern Jew in the best sense of the word.
It was said of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol that he spoke seven languages, all of them in Yiddish.
In the international arena, Eban's pen was his sword, and the spoken word his lance.
His was the aristocracy of the spirit.
Unfortunately, like so many other international agreements, the Convention on Biological Diversity remains essentially unknown, un-championed, and unfulfilled.
Consider a couple of notorious examples.
Likewise, in many parts of the world, tropical rainforest is being cleared for pasture land and food crops.
Such areas not only permit the regeneration of species, but also provide ecological benefits that spill over to neighboring unprotected areas.
These measures are achievable by 2010.
The Nigerian government’s own accountability is on the line as well.
The cleanup of the Niger Delta provides an ideal opportunity for Nigeria, the oil industry, and the international community to show convincingly that a new age has dawned.
As Goldstone's report makes clear:
(Para. 1705)
This is true in the public as well as the private sector.
The absurdity here is the idea that all foreign aid should be added to reserves.
This makes sense.
But in most cases, this is not possible.
Europe’s citizens understand that the relatively small nation-states that make up the EU are no longer able to face these enormous challenges on their own.
As for the European People’s Party, for us the economy is not an end in itself but should serve the people.
This is, in part, inevitable.
That has now changed.
Not anymore.
For example, only 8% of the $409 billion spent on fossil-fuel subsidies in 2010 reached the poorest 20% of the population.
Adapting to Climate Change
They first look at the different ways that climate change will affect us at mid-century.
Farmers will choose plants that thrive in heat.
The Mouse Click that Roared
Finally, a reputation for offensive capability and a declared policy that keeps open the means of retaliation can help to reinforce deterrence.
The government can (and has) cut wages in the public sector, but this is not sufficient.
Contrary to popular perception, the public-sector wage bill is only of marginal importance.
Returning the eurozone’s peripheral economies to the path of growth requires more than structural reforms and fiscal consolidation.
For such a deal to become possible, certain preconditions must be met.
The sovereign-debt crisis is well known.
The US is gradually transferring resources from creditors to debtors through financial repression.
Of course, such advice, like much of newspapers themselves nowadays, comes free of charge.
But it is also advice that is free of responsibility, and, as Stanley Baldwin once said, power without responsibility is the prerogative of the harlot.
The subtext is clear: be like us now.
In many cases, the cohesiveness of opposition movements that come to power in the wake of a political upheaval may not be what the international media presume it to be.
Indeed, some components of these so-called “democratic coalitions” may not be democratic at all.
How can we help ensure these movements’ sustainability in such fluid moments?
Where to start?
The notion that a dictator can claim the sovereign right to abuse his people has become unacceptable.
In most cases, neither can be remedied overnight.
Affirmative Action for Europe
Affirmative action, or “positive discrimination,” as some have called these policies, began with university admissions.
But, in the early 1970’s, President Richard M. Nixon expanded the scope of affirmative action.
But they remain in existence three decades later.
In France, by contrast, the appointment of the black anchorwoman Audrey Pulvar was big news on its own, because most of her colleagues in France are white.
And French businesses don’t see it as their role to solve the problems of the suburbs.
Specifically, we are told, the goal should be a 50% reduction in global carbon-dioxide emissions by the middle of the century.
Allow me to explain.
Can we do this?
In a word, yes.
How large?
But is it really?
Consider one of the miracles of the modern age – the personal computer.
These devices didn’t become household items because governments subsidized purchases or forced up the price of typewriters and slide rules.
No, what happened is that, largely as a result of the space race, the United States government poured lots of money into R&amp;D for solid-state physics and electronics engineering.
Collective decisions are taken by patriarchs in councils calledjirgas, where all have to be in agreement.
Women are excluded from collective decision-making, as they are mere objects.
This may mean dying in childbirth rather than risking the “dishonor” of giving birth in a public place, a hospital, in front of strangers.
Iranian films and the much loved Indian TV serials, not to mention the occasional American film, influence peoples' expectations.
The West imagines that religion is the central issue in Afghanistan.
Forestry has always been a problem in Afghanistan.
Aerial photographers were called in, and a large budget was set aside.
Many, perhaps most, are under sixteen years of age.
But note that it occurred near a health facility.
Even before that, she would have noticed that the child had not turned properly, and that major problems were on the way.
Afghanistan’s Feminist Revolution
Both houses of Parliament had approved the law, and President Hamid Karzai signed it.
On the contrary, the feminism expressed by women such as these Afghani heroines should educate us in the West about our own shortcomings.
Of course, Afghanistan does not bear sole responsibility for its plight.
Counter-insurgency and counter-narcotics are two sides of the same coin.
That situation needs to be reversed.
Third, family pride and honor are deemed more important than a woman’s individual well-being and safety.
Africa, Climate Change, and the G-8 Summit
These may seem to be distinct issues.
In fact, they are linked.
A trip I took to a village in the Tigre region in northern Ethiopia shows why.
Ethiopian village life has long depended on two crops, one during a short rain in March and April, and the main crop during the long rain in the summer months.
Greater help for these countries to escape from extreme poverty has been promised for decades but has not been delivered.
While adaptation to climate change is necessary – because it is already occurring – this is not enough.
The best way to reduce long-term climate change is to reduce carbon emissions.
Most likely, all three of these methods will have to play a role.
Africa at Risk
ADDIS ABABA – Climate change will hit Africa – a continent that has contributed virtually nothing to bring it about – first and hardest.
A transitional financing arrangement would be put in place for the period 2010-2015.
Clearly this is not about the availability of resources.
Something troubled me about this formulation, too.
It was that word "development" again.
Just because some "best practice" works in New York, does that mean it will work in Accra, Ghana?
Was Kofi Annan "developed?"
One thing is clear.
Countries like Ghana do not lack enterprise.
Markets and personal initiative are pervasive.
Pride, dignity, and self-confidence do not figure in economic theory: they cannot be measured.
But they figure prominently in just about every story of success, whether of countries or of leaders.
Globalization must not be allowed to blind us.
The performers were a troupe of young African singers, drummers and dancers, ranging in age from roughly eight to 28.
Rarely have I been so profoundly moved.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; “This is a land,” they sang,
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Africa.
O Africa.”
Each of those splendid performers is living with HIV.
There the scourge began in earnest; there (as elsewhere in Africa) it exacts its highest toll.
Yet Uganda is also a success story.
How do you choose to treat a young girl but not her little brother?
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We are still useful.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; All we need is to survive in Africa.
Africa\u0027s Child Soldiers
As a boy, when you join an army, you think you are going to see war as in the movies.
I was 15 years old and part of a movement that aimed to rid my country of the corrupt regime of Milton Obote, who had succeeded the murderous Idi Amin.
The war was over. But not for me.
In Uganda, and in most other sub-Saharan countries, more than 40% of the population is under the age of 15.
Every country groans under the burden of educating, employing and absorbing so many young people.
Only education will.
African youth must be introduced to democracy and pacifism in the classroom.
Domestic capital markets were non-existent.
Africa’s Dictator-Diplomat
Meles’s own political provenance as the leader of the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front was Marxist-Leninist.
For example, groups like Freedom House and Human Rights Watch have documented widespread official repression of the Oromo people.
In the Horn of Africa, there is no leader of his stature who could ensure the stability and strong governance that the region so desperately needs.
He will be remembered as an African leader of major historical significance: visionary, despotic, and indispensable.
Africa’s Hard Black Gold
LAGOS - Few infrastructure services in the developed world may be as taken for granted as electric power.
To consumers in industrialized countries, uninterrupted power supply is a given.
There is no shortage of hydropower plants for electricity generation in Africa.
Furthermore, they are prone to frequent drought, which reduces their output significantly, leaving many as little more than decorative infrastructure landmarks.
Other resources like fuel oil, diesel, light crude, solar, and gas are also available as means of electricity generation, but their costs are all quite prohibitive.
Africa has about 50 billion tons.
It is already the dominant source of power generation in some very important energy-consuming nations.
The same is true for Germany, which is home to some of the most efficient pulverized coal combustion units in Europe.
It must be mined with greater efficiency and with a view to mitigating the environmental impact.
Fortunately, much greater attention is paid today to mine safety and the management of the by-products of coal use.
Africa’s Immunity
ACCRA – The United States suffers rising job losses.
Yet, in sub-Saharan Africa, there are few hints of the global financial crisis that is consuming the capitalist world.
In fashionable African cities, residential home prices remain stratospheric.
People tend to pay cash for goods and services, however costly.
Africa’s Integration Imperative
This is the case for Europe, Asia, and, increasingly, Latin America, particularly among the member states of Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay).
DAKAR – Sub-Saharan African is in the grip of currency-union mania.
But haven’t we heard this all before in Africa?
This led only to structural deficits, vast capital flight, and, in 1994, a 100% devaluation.
But today resources flow from Africa to creditors, rather than the reverse.
Tomorrow?
Africa\u0027s Quest for Power
Limited energy development in Africa has resulted in one of the lowest uses of modern energy sources in the world.
As a result, most Africans use biomass (animal and vegetable wastes and firewood) for lighting, cooking, and heating.
Families in rural and semi-rural areas often have no choice but to exploit what they perceive as a "free" energy source.
Improvements in energy supplies have multiple beneficial effects.
More informed citizens, in turn, participate at a higher rate and to a greater degree in their country's decision-making processes.
Africa’s Urban Farmers
Even with mother’s help, I have worries.
One key tool is the mobile phone.
Certain crops can be grown in their own homes.
In a new advertising campaign rolled out this summer, the authorities declared, “The soil is a bank; invest in it.”
In Zambia, for example, Sylva Banda ignited a craze for authentic traditional meals two decades ago with a chain of popular restaurants.
The revival of traditional foods has attracted the attention of large multinational corporations.
But the facts on the ground do not bear this out.
Even so, the ICC prosecutor’s application for an arrest warrant for al-Bashir – announced this past July – has yet to provoke a widely-feared crackdown on humanitarian organizations.
In short, more law, rather than less, is needed to help stem the violence. 
Second, the ICC is said to have allowed itself to become a tool of national political leaders.
Nevertheless, Africa is the site of many of the world’s worst conflicts.
Reprisals were swift, and at least 50 Muslims were killed in three days of violence in the southeastern (predominantly Christian) cities of Onitsha and Enugu.
Africa has been described as a continent having a triple heritage, and the African Muslim, too, has a split personality.
He must decide whether he is a Muslim first, then a member of his tribe, say, Hausa, and then of his nation, say, Nigeria.
Nevertheless, the Federal Republic of Nigeria is a secular state, as are almost all sub-Saharan African states.
Ahmad Dudin, former Fatah leader in Hebron, summed up the dilemma this way: "The Palestinian Authority has always been a one-man operation.
That is the problem."
He is 74 years old, and cannot be described as healthy.
So what will happen when a transition is forced on the Palestinian movement by his demise?
In a certain sense, Arafat is the Palestinian Authority (PA).
While nominally the Palestinians have a collective leadership, the reality is that Arafat has overwhelming control.
He has been the Palestinian movement's sole leader almost from the day he founded it in 1959.
These aims are never going to be realized, but they also have never been subordinated to "ending the occupation," so they form the glue of Palestinian nationalism.
During that interregnum, we should expect deadlock, anarchy, or civil war.
In the nineteenth century, millions of Europeans sought liberty and prosperity in the Americas, notably in the United States.
The African boat people in the Mediterranean are often not even sure whether they want to be in Italy, Germany, or Britain.
But it cannot be had for nothing.
Berlin's Turkish community and the North African communities around Paris seem increasingly separate, with their own public sphere and often language.
Worse, seldom is it explained how to square the circle.
Shutting down a vital source of electrical energy, which Chernobyl remains, is no an easy task, particularly with winter upon us.
We also bear the responsibilities involved in laying off Chernobyl’s workers and depriving the adjacent city of Slavutych (population 28,000), of its main source of income.
At long last, our society and economy are set on the path to growth and development.
To ensure complete transparency in the tender process, and eliminate problems experienced in the past, Western advisors are assisting us.
Our energy companies service a territory the size of France; they will all be privatized.
Euroatom is also helping with a loan of $585 million to finance repairs at Ukraine’s functioning nuclear power plants.
We are a European nation.
We realize that no one will implement reforms for us.
After Dictatorship
Many of us fought against the apparent "restoration" of the old regime.
Ex-communists were often reincarnated politically as social democrats.
This has a great deal to do with methods of dealing with the past.
The road from the collapse of a dictatorial regime backed by ideology to a more liberal order leads through a valley of tears.
The Kyoto Protocol treaty has now entered into force for the 126 nations who have joined it so far.
Therefore, projects need to be operational at the latest by 2007.
Two decades of applying neoliberal economic policies to the developing world have yielded disappointing results.
Discovering what works in any one country requires experimentation.
After all, institutions are not hot-house plants capable of being planted in any soil and climate.
Neoliberalism is to neoclassical economics as astrology is to astronomy.
After Pax Americana?
SEOUL – Korea is a unique country.
The Cold War ended when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and is now remembered only as history to most people around the world.
For example, Kim Il Sung groomed his son Kim Jong-il as his successor for about two decades before the younger Kim took power in 1994.
Indeed, the revolution is already upon us.
For the first time in history, a global techno-market order is transforming the world of finance, business, politics and, indeed, physiology, beyond recognition.
Innovative start-up firms become huge companies faster than ever before.
In this world without utopia, individual freedom is the supreme value.
This conflict exists globally.
After the God that Failed
Not only political forces need to be checked.
How much more worrying, then, is such concentrated ownership in new democracies and developing countries, where the check of civil society is mostly absent?
In defense I wish to cite the great Harvard philosopher John Rawls, who died recently.
After the Golden Age of Finance
This is a huge contrast with the financial sector’s position in the previous three decades.
By 2007, the figure was over 400% in the US, the United Kingdom, and Japan.
This was the golden age of finance.
A recent study by Andy Haldane and others at the Bank of England casts doubt on the prospect of a return to the status quo ante.
They note that the Golden Age was in fact an unusual period, if you look at the last two centuries of economic history.
But this excess growth has not been evenly spread.
After the Greek Default
That will not be easy.
After the Guns of August
The Middle East is a place where the dust hardly ever settles.
Let’s start with the United States.
As for America, anything it touches in the Middle East has become radioactive, even for longstanding clients and friends.
The long overdue UN Resolution 1701 may, with its adoption, indicate that all parties are fatigued, or could no longer withstand international pressure.
After the Millennium Development Goals
By contrast, between 2002 and 2008, Spain’s population grew by 700,000 a year, driven largely by immigration.
In the US, alligator-filled moats and electrified border fences have featured in the current presidential campaign.
The gaps in these countries’ labor markets – from software specialists to physicians to home health aides – will be immense.
Meanwhile, the Global Forum on Migration and Development, established in 2007, has quickly become an important means of fostering knowledge and partnerships.
When it comes to migration, we are all in the same boat – and that boat is leaking.
After the Taliban
A massive impediment here is the millions of mines left over from the Soviet invasion that must be removed.
Housing, particularly for returning refugees, will need to be constructed fast.
Village housing must be provided at a massive level.
Roads, airports and communications systems must also be revitalized if trade is to be restored.
Particular attention should be given to elementary schools and libraries outside of cities.
Afghanistan poses particular difficulties in reconstruction, as it is not a society with a strong political center.
There is the potential for oil and gas exploration, and of mining iron ore and precious metals.
These activities should be explored in a framework of economic development across Central Asia.
After the War on Terror
Among emerging-markets, the Philippines and Indonesia are the most exposed to Japan, which absorbs about 16% of their total exports.
Against Simplification
NEW YORK – It is said that Americans have a genius for simplification.
Too many valid choices are ignored or skirted through the routine of short-cuts.
The theme, style, and echo of his work says a lot, I think, about our simplified world.
The novel is Blinding, by Claudio Magris.
The book’s plot spans two centuries of revolution.
Then, suddenly,
It is also a rich and original literary achievement that challenges today’s consumerist ethic.
Ethics and Agriculture
MELBOURNE – Should rich countries – or investors based there – be buying agricultural land in developing countries?
After all, we do not allow poor people to sell their kidneys to the highest bidder.
Most people can live without one kidney.
In 2000, Africa was struggling with three major epidemics.
These interconnected crises prompted action.
The United Nations’ member states adopted the Millennium Development Goals in September 2000.
Many innovative public-health techniques were developed and adopted.
The MDGs for health could be achieved even in many of the world’s poorest countries.
Alan Greenspan on Trial
The release of Alan Greenspan’s ghostwritten memoirs The Age of Turbulence has elicited charges that he was not such a great central banker after all.
Here, Greenspan holds his ground, and pleads not guilty.
Alexander Hamilton’s Eurozone Tour
For many, Alexander Hamilton has become a contemporary hero.
Perhaps one day his face should appear on the €10 banknote.
There were two sides to his case, one practical, the other philosophical.
Indeed, public virtue made federal finance what he called “the powerful cement of our union.”
In the American case, however, unity carried a price: a ceiling was imposed on Virginia’s exposure to the common debt.
Two important components of Hamilton’s financial architecture were not realized, or were realized imperfectly.
In fact, the fiscal union proved to be explosive rather than adhesive.
A wave of state defaults followed in the late 1830’s.
One doomed officer famously declared, “You can’t hang us all.”
All for One Tax and One Tax for All?
And the crisis was a once-in-a-half-century event.
Better to rein in the growth of the system.
All in the Family
MUNICH – Big economic crises often cause iconic companies to falter.
It was not just that he was Australian; he also brought new ideas.
This sort of firm is also very common in the most dynamic emerging-market economies in Asia and Latin America.
For decades, academic analysts have been fighting over whether such large-scale family businesses should be considered beneficial.
The second notorious weakness of family businesses is the problem of succession.
In old-style family firms, there is a clear rule of succession that the oldest son takes over.
There is obviously no guarantee that the oldest son is the best businessman, and the result could be bitter and ferocious sibling rivalry.
As a result of globalization, large family firms could increase their size and their geographic range.
All Man’s Land
NEW DELHI – Ernest Hemingway’s collection of stories, Men without Women, examines tense gender relationships.
Frustrated, the woman gives in.
Ratios in the northern states are particularly alarming: only Himachal Pradesh now has a ratio of girls to boys above 900.
But there are serious concerns about legal operations, too.
In short, sons represent income and daughters an expense.
In the old days, when families typically had 5-10 children, this didn’t matter so much.
The number of sons and daughters often evened out.
Many have argued that Indian women should stand up to their families and refuse to abort their daughters.
But Indian women want male children just as much.
Unlike Hemingway’s character, they are often more than willing to abort a girl and try for a boy.
And there is no easy way to accomplish this.
Culturally, she feels that she does not have an equal claim on her father’s property.
Gradually, this would become the norm, and tradition would adjust accordingly.
India imagines herself as a woman – Bharat Mata, or Mother India.
All Quiet on the Burundi Front?
Like its neighbors, Congo and Rwanda, Burundi is a war-torn land.
But, unlike its neighbors, this year can mark a turning point for Burundi.
The first such cause is the legacy of colonization.
Currently, insecurity is confined to the area surrounding Bujumbura, the capital, where theForces Nationales de libération, a small radical group, continue to fight.
The presidents of Uganda and Tanzania, and the international community in general, also exerted leverage.
Through May, property prices were up 18% year on year.
For China, leadership means assuming additional risks.
All the Queen’s Children
Similarly, while Britain has many outstanding musicians, the favorite of the royal court is Elton John.
The current Japanese empress and her daughter-in-law, both from non-aristocratic families, have had nervous breakdowns as a result.
Likewise, movie stars often fall victim to alcohol, drugs, and breakdowns, but at least they have chosen the lives they live.
Kings and queens, on the whole, have not.
Prince Charles might have been far happier as a gardener, but this was never an option.
Monarchies are often popular with minorities.
Jews were among the most loyal subjects of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor.
Franz Joseph I stood up for his Jewish subjects when they were threatened by German anti-Semites.
This offered some protection to minorities at a time of rising ethnic nationalism.
That is what she means when she preaches tolerance and mutual understanding.
To them, the queen seems almost anti-Dutch.
To be sure, like all European royal families, the origins of the Dutch royal family are decidedly mixed.
Empires contained many nations, after all.
Queen Victoria, mostly of German blood, did not regard herself as a monarch of Britons alone, but of Indians, Malays, and many other peoples, too.
Alpine Schadenfreude
There was still some of that at Davos.
If we know the price of cream and the price of skim milk, we can figure out the price of milk with 1% cream, 2% cream, or 4% cream.
It was interesting to see the different cultural attitudes to the crisis on display.
VIRGINIA BEACH – The problem of long-term energy sources has been drifting towards crisis for decades.
We need something on the scale of the Manhattan Project (which created the atomic bomb), or the Apollo Program (which put a man on the moon).
Both the Apollo Program and the Manhattan Project had unique characteristics.
But this results in endless efforts to make non-ideal methods less troublesome.
Such a paradigm shift requires an Apollo-scale investment, but in basic science.
Quite apart from daily sunlight, for instance, Earth is bombarded by all sorts of other radiation from outside our solar system.
An even more mysterious effect occurs on Earth with living creatures.
When we burn wood, we reverse the process, unraveling that order and producing energy.
With such a fresh perspective on matter, new potentials could emerge.
The United States is unlikely in the short term to embrace massive budget cuts, à la the United Kingdom.
An especially egregious form of corporate special treatment is that afforded to the drug companies.
Even the traditional Arab monarchies and Emirates are changing in its wake.
Crown Prince Abdullah, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler in place of his incapacitated half-brother King Fahd, is keen to be seen as a champion of reform.
Crown Prince Abdullah offered not a peep of opposition, leaving the reform agenda that he initiated in a political netherworld.
Several of these are also being advanced within the Bush administration.
But the debate may also go the other way.
This is easier said than done.
But they already did, twice.
Of course, pure public goods are rare.
For the Dreamliner to take off, ascend, and maintain a steady altitude, it must do more than move forward.
It has to move forward fast enough to exceed critical physical thresholds, which are significantly higher than those for most of Boeing’s other (smaller) planes.
This is where the insights of Steve Jobs, one of the world’s best innovators and entrepreneurs, come in.
America Confronts Old and New Europe
He meant it to refer to Europe's divisions, but in May, ten additional states joined the European Union.
Of course, this new Europe faces many problems.
If anything, the risks of a US-Europe split will be reduced rather than increased by the EU's recent enlargement.
The Indian government has lost no time in raising these objections – as well as the prospect of a formal WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism complaint.
America Goes from Teacher to Student
The US should do the same.
America should start to listen before it is too late.
These tactics worked.
America’s Anti-Immigrant Road Rage
When I talked to immigrants in Oakland, they called their license “tu licencia con dios,” or “your license with God.”
The California experience is a case in point.
America’s Arab Comeback
Arab youth had to fight and win democracy for themselves.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Consider the following charges:
The other 97 deficits did not magically appear.
That could take all of us to the edge of a slippery slope.
The United States is something different.
Once upon a time, according to mythology at least, America had little downward mobility.
Setting out for the Western Territory was expensive. Covered wagons were not cheap.
What would it add?
Now things are very different.
The typical American employer is no longer General Motors.
It is Wal-Mart.
Syria and September 11
A slightly revised version of that legislation remains in force.
A critical part of its role must be to consider with care the limits that should be placed on a punitive strike.
America’s Constrained Choice
NEWPORT BEACH – The conventional wisdom about the November presidential election in the United States is only partly correct.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s unusual activism, including an ever-expanding list of experimental measures, will yield fewer benefits and entail growing costs and risks.
It is certainly not an either/or proposition.
If elected, he would be the oldest incoming president.
His choice of Alaska’s Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate shook up the presidential campaign.
If anything, some of Obama’s Democratic supporters wish he would show more emotion in responding to criticism.
Some people worry that Obama might be good for American soft power, but not for its hard power.
Machiavelli famously said that it is more important for a prince to be feared than to be loved.
And Machiavelli made it clear that hatred is something a prince should carefully avoid.
The government had allowed bankers to “negotiate” the results, like a student taking a final examination and then negotiating her grade.
The feared implosion of Wall Street seems to have been avoided.
On the contrary, they are now the government’s partners in a joint venture to manage this dishonest scheme.
It must be raised again this summer if the United States government is to continue paying its bills on time.
America’s Day of Reckoning
The story goes back to the recession of 2001.
American productivity is among the highest in the world.
In the American political lexicon, taxes are defined as a denial of liberty.
The world should beware.
America’s Election and the Global Economy
The most important differences between the two candidates can be summarized as follows:
Spending.
Taxes.
Trade.
Regulation.
The household sector is especially important.
That means forgoing some government services.
With the tradable sector neutralized and the non-tradable sectors maxed out, the economy lacks sufficiently powerful growth engines.
The first path is better: not only do you get more jobs, but you also get more useful stuff produced.
A year ago, it set five policy initiatives in motion:
• Recapitalization of banks that appeared very vulnerable;
• Expansion of extraordinary policy interventions by the Federal Reserve.
In practice, that means that the government either hires people and puts them to work or induces businesses to hire more people.
Don’t hold your breath.
It backs the Ethiopian army in Somalia.
It occupies Iraq and Afghanistan.
It supports the military dictatorship in Pakistan.
The US then backed Saddam Hussein in his attack on Iran, until the US ended up attacking Saddam himself.
Another 16% went straight to the Pakistani budget, no questions asked.
We all breathe the same air.
Today, it is 8.4% of GDP, and it is not shrinking.
DENVER – Patience might be a virtue, but not necessarily when it comes to American foreign policy.
In part, it represents a fundamental – some would say fundamentalist – view that taxes are to government what a bottle of whisky is to an alcoholic.
In places like rural El Paso County, on the eastern plains of Colorado, far from the federal budget debate’s epicenter, spending cuts are the order of the day.
These cuts are having a very real and immediate impact on El Paso County’s residents.
When was the last time the US government did that for a US zoo (outside of Washington, of course)?
But what if there is no money to offer?
America’s Free-Trade Abdication
But there was no response from the US government.
Indeed, it is notable that, while Obama’s State of the Union address in January 2010 at least mentioned Doha, his address in January 2011 did not.
Likewise, the US continues to lead in entrepreneurship, research and development, higher education, and technological innovation.
The Maddening of America
BOSTON – The relative global decline of the United States has become a frequent topic of debate in recent years.
America’s Groucho Marxists
LONDON – Groucho Marx has always been my favorite Marxist.
It didn’t matter what you could see with your own eyes.
You had to accept what you were told the world was like.
Reality was whatever the ruling party said it was.
Change can be made in an evolutionary, rather than a revolutionary, way.
It is hugely expensive.
Too many of the sick are untreated.
Communism in Toronto and London?
Maybe it’s no coincidence that Groucho Marx was an American citizen.
The first run on a bank occurred against the British mortgage lender Northern Rock.
And trades do go wrong: remember the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management.
For where should they park their money?
That simply will not work, even in the short term.
BRUSSELS – “Sometime they’ll give a war and nobody will come,” the American poet Carl Sandburg wrote hopefully in 1936.
Rather, wars are increasingly fought remotely, with drones – or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) – doing the killing.
In March 2011, the US Air Force for the first time trained more pilots for drones than for any other purpose.
From a legal and human-rights point of view, the US drone program is even more alarming.
More than a decade after September 11, America’s drone program does not fall into the first category of reactive self-defense.
Accountability is also being flouted.
Drone operations are carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency, an organization whose activities are shrouded in secrecy.
Another six months should not be lost.
Here, too, another six months should not be lost.
Likewise, the US could have fulfilled its normal role as the conductor of the international economic orchestra.
Another six months have been lost.
But the US government won’t address them.
But so far in the third millennium, this skill – or simply run of luck – has deserted the US.
That America may be gone for good.
Officials and others who favor stimulating growth through increased government spending ignore the CBO’s more realistic alternative scenario.
Residential investment should be a source of output and job growth this year.
It is time to refocus.
We should heed his wisdom.
America’s New Progressive Era?
Government is the problem.”
Reagan’s statement in 1981 was extraordinary.
For Cambodia, the figure would be about 62%.
(Indeed, it has already had more than 11 years to adjust to liberalization of textiles.)
The cause is no secret.
None of this can occur in a vacuum.
America\u0027s Other 87 Deficits
NEW HAVEN – The United States has a classic multilateral trade imbalance.
While it runs a large trade deficit with China, it also runs deficits with 87 other countries.
In that vein, closing down trade with China, while failing to address the saving shortfall, is like putting pressure on one end of a water balloon.
Now the game is up.
NEW HAVEN – The spin-doctors are hard at work talking up America’s subpar economic recovery.
All eyes are on households.
Don’t believe it.
One of the first concepts to which an economics student is exposed in a basic macro course is “pent-up” consumer demand.
In 1896, future President Theodore Roosevelt was a Republican attack dog.
But neither Perry nor Kobach is likely ever to be a US president, whereas Theodore Roosevelt was more than a partisan.
And the Republican cadres believe this of Obama even more than they believed it of Clinton.
That was the Republicans’ calculation in 2011-2012.
Let us hope that it will be short and shallow.
It would enhance US economic competitiveness, especially relative to Europe, given the lower costs involved in the extraction of shale gas.
In 2005, it widened further, and the dollar only strengthened.
On top of all this, the US military, rather than being a burden, feeds the country’s technological superiority by subsidizing basic research.
For the moment, America’s ability to borrow vast sums at low interest rates acts like a huge dose of steroids on the economy.
At some point, the party is going to end.
Can the end come abruptly in 2006?
America’s Strategy Vacuum
They should.
Yes, these are controversial policies.
Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter famously raised this concern in a 1996 article in the Harvard Business Review.
America’s Political Class Struggle
This month, they succeeded, at least for now.
With their backs against the wall, I predict, poor and working-class Americans will begin to agitate for social justice.
That sum will not come from the poor.
Will America really let its public infrastructure continue to deteriorate?
Obama swept to power on the promise of change.
America\u0027s Problems Run Deeper than Wall Street
Even in those states where mortgages are not “no recourse” loans, creditors generally do not pursue the assets or income of individuals who default.
Without this confidence, credit will not flow and economic activity will be constrained.
The US Congress and the Bush administration enacted a $100 billion tax rebate in an attempt to stimulate consumer spending.
Our support was, in the words of Samuel Johnson, a triumph of hope over experience.
ARLINGTON – The rapprochement between the United States and Myanmar (Burma) has proceeded at a blistering pace.
In the heart of Yangon, the golden dome of the Sule Pagoda stands just across the street from the minarets of the Bengali Mosque.
Bachmann, on the other hand,&#160;is portrayed as being slightly unhinged.
This is especially true of Bachmann.
But Bachman, weirdly, might become President of the United States.
They use emotive rhetoric.
They create an “us versus them” scenario.
Militarily, this argument does make sense.
America’s Saving Surprise
Before that, between 1960 and 1985, American households saved an average of 9% of their after-tax incomes.
Mortgages became more widely available.
The stock market dropped sharply.
This is easy to demonstrate.
Inflation is 1.5% per year. And overall productivity growth is 3.5% per year.
For the US to have a rate of productivity growth of 3.5% per annum rather than the pre-1995 rate of 1.2% is amazing.
America’s Scorched Earth Management
Productivity is a measure of output per hour worked.
A sustainable company is not a collection of “human resources.”
It is a community of human beings.
Its strength resides in its people, its culture, and the goodwill it has built up among its customers and suppliers.
America\u0027s Second Gilded Age
The poorest Congressional district is a largely Hispanic-immigrant district in Los Angeles, with a per-capita income of $6,997 a year.
By contrast, the richest 5% of America's families in 1973 had an average income of $149,150, and in 2000 the richest 5% had an average income of $254,840.
What happened?
So why don't Americans feel more alarm at their country's rising income inequality?
But somebody ten years old when Franklin Roosevelt was elected is now eighty.
Inequality, it seems, is as American as apple pie.
Why should the rest of the world think that conflict with a larger and more resolute enemy would be handled any more capably?
With rare exceptions, politics has become a discredited profession throughout the West.
Now the West is paying the price.
America’s Sleeping Watch Dog
But perhaps this is not too great a deviation, for the behavior of the press affects not only politics, but economics as well.
Look at how Bush had operated as president of the Texas Rangers baseball club, they said.
He spent his time making sure the political coalition to support the Texas Rangers in the style to which it wanted to be accustomed remained stable.
He was not just under-briefed, but also lazy: he insisted on remaining under-briefed.
I really do not know.
America’s Socialism for the Rich
This is not just theory; it is a lesson we learned, at great expense, during the Savings &amp; Loan crisis of the 1980’s.
The Obama administration has, however, introduced a new concept: too big to be financially restructured.
Some have called this new economic regime “socialism with American characteristics.”
And, if we don’t break them up, then we have to severely limit what they do.
There was no mistaking the power and symbolism of the opening ceremonies for the Beijing Olympic Games on August 8.
MADRID – The Pacific or the Middle East?
For the United States, that is now the primary strategic question.
Military intervention in Iran – which itself will be holding a presidential election in June – would incite not only regional, but global, instability.
America’s Suicidal Statecraft
Consider the Middle East.
America’s Threat to Trans-Pacific Trade
But a closer look reveals that China is not a part of this agenda.
From the outset, the TPP’s supposed openness has been wholly misleading.
But it is too early to celebrate.
Even if the economy grows at 2.5% in 2012, as most forecasts anticipate, the jobs deficit will remain – and will not be closed until 2024.
But US policy choices are responsible for the erosion of America’s competitiveness.
America’s Unhinged “Pivot”
That change has come as a relief to those in the region who fear being forced to choose between the US and China.
The war changed that equation.
Taxes are raised.
For the first time since the Revolutionary War, two centuries ago, America has had to turn to foreigners for financing, because US households have been saving nothing .
For the international human rights movement, this is a severe setback.
Its own prestige is high: groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are respected voices, to whom many governments feel obliged to pay attention.
There is also the promise of new institutions.
That seems to be happening.
Both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers, and the history of bloody warfare between them presents a major and ongoing security threat to South Asia.
But, at the same time, his administration was holding approximately 400 prisoners at the US Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba.
Some of them have now been there for more than five years.
In these conditions, “most urinated or defecated on [them]selves.”
They were left there for 18 or 24 hours, or more.
On one of these occasions, the agent reported, “the air conditioning was turned up so low that the barefooted detainee was shaking with cold.”
He was then taken to an interrogation room where he saw a longhaired man with a full beard who was gagged with duct tape that “covered much of his head.”
The FBI report noted these incidents with the comment: “doesn’t seem excessive given Department of Defense policy.”
Some were picked up in Bosnia, Indonesia, Thailand, Mauritania, and Pakistan.
But the CIA has made mistakes before.
A German court has now issued arrest warrants for those involved in his abduction.
If America would only follow that advice, it might really be a beacon of hope and a shining example.
America the Pariah
The basic situation has been clear for years.
Deserts and dry regions are becoming drier.
It is too early to count on success in engaging the US on climate change.
But the effort needs to start now.
For Eberstadt, the problem is that dependence on government is emasculating, and that too many people are dependent on government.
For Brooks, it is that knowing that public programs make one’s life easier causes one to vote for non-Republican candidates.
The crucial point is that America’s conservative elites believe Brooks, Eberstadt, and Murray.
In retrospect, the charge seems like rank hypocrisy.
She even had an oil tanker named after her.
Commerce Secretary Don Evans is also an oil-company CEO.
But what is happening here is more than "guilt by association" with the oil industry.
Before joining the Pentagon, Donald Rumsfeld was a key player as well.
Rumsfeld's hidden mission was to win Saddam's support of a Bechtel-built oil pipeline to run from Iraq via Jordan to the Gulf of Aqaba.
American newspapers now report that former Shell Oil CEO Philip Carroll will be appointed as the US czar of Iraqi oil.
The danger of their approach is now obvious.
Americans now view cooperative action on global climate change more favorably.
They follow you home.
It must be rooted in the indigenous society and bear its characteristics, not be imposed from abroad.
America’s Enemy Within
Like Samson in the temple of Gaza, he wishes to destroy himself in a public act of violence, taking as many people as possible with him.
In the case of Tamerlan, a talented boxer, he was denied the chance to become a champion because he was not yet a United States citizen.
More interesting, and in a way far more disturbing, has been the reaction in the US to the Boston bombings, which killed three people and injured 264.
Until the surviving bomber was found, Boston was reduced to a ghost town.
It shows how vulnerable a modern city can be when its leaders lose their nerve.
Like the Spanish, they were used to it.
The evil outside world should not be able to touch the Land of the Free.
When it does – Pearl Harbor, September 2001 – all hell breaks loose.
Such bonds can be useful, even necessary, in times of war.
As common criminals, such groups’ members would not achieve this goal.
They simply lost the will, in Rudyard Kipling’s famous words, to fight “the savage wars of peace.”
Subtitled “The United States and the Philippine Islands,” it was published in 1899, just as the US was waging a “savage war of peace” of its own.
It is difficult to sustain an empire without the will to use force when necessary.
Like Chaudhuri, Kagan is an engaging writer.
This is the conceit of all great powers.
Spreading democracy was not the main concern; stopping communism – in Asia, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas – was.
The Chinese are steadily gaining influence in Africa, not with bombers, but with money.
American Gulag
The numbers buttressing this sprawling prison system are extraordinary.
America today has five times as many prisoners as it did in 1980.
American Pie in the Sky
American Power after Bin Laden
But the term is confusing.
For example, in the seventeenth century, the Netherlands flourished domestically but declined in relative power as other states grew in strength.
Of the 8.6 million British forces in WWI, nearly one-third were provided by the overseas empire.
The Founding Fathers worried about comparisons to the decline of the Roman republic.
In 1992, the winner of the New Hampshire primary election argued that "the Cold War is over - and Japan won."
This is misleading.
But in a decade or two, Chinese may become the language of the largest number of Internet users.
American Power in the Twenty-First Century
One should beware of misleading metaphors of organic decline.
Rome remained dominant for more than three centuries after the apogee of Roman power.
What resources will produce power?
The child who dominates on the playground may become a laggard when the context changes to a disciplined classroom.
In today’s world, the distribution of power varies with the context.
The bottom chessboard is the realm of cross-border transactions that occur outside of government control.
In this sense, power becomes a positive sum game.
In February 1984, facing a quagmire, Reagan acceded to Vice President George H.W. Bush’s recommendation to get out of Lebanon.
In 1992, the sirens of Somalia’s political collapse lured the US into another civil war to save a country from itself.
Following Ethiopia’s intervention, the Islamists found themselves out of power.
The result is the stable region that the world sees today.
But the US saw things very differently in the 1960’s, when the ghosts of Munich hovered over Vietnam’s jungles.
Rather than the dominos falling following America’s retreat from Saigon in 1975, a Vietnam-Cambodian War ensued.
This in turn stimulated China’s unsuccessful intervention in North Vietnam.
Other responses appall many in the US as well.
Americans recognize that a violation of anyone’s rights threatens the rights of all.
Amnesty for Saddam?
Is such an amnesty a good idea?
These are weighty questions.
savage reprisals against the Shiites in southern Iraq in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War;
It cannot consider crimes committed prior to July 1, 2002.
If Saddam is ready to abdicate to preserve his life, he should get that much security, no more.
He could not move freely.
So some of the stars have come into alignment for Bush.
An Age of Diminished Expectations?
There are no simple shortcuts in the healing process.
(This theme underlies the title of Krugman’s classic 1990 book “The Age of Diminished Expectations.”)
Since the mid-1990’s, the relative decline in employment in these countries has, indeed, been slightly reversed.
There have been no major differences between the US and the large euro zone economies here.
The main lapse in TFP growth in Europe over the past decade has been in services (excluding information and communications technologies).
Unfortunately, reform was derailed in 2005.
An Alliance of Civilizations?
This is a historic fallacy.
Tolerance and religious freedom must be mutual.
An Alliance of Equals
But what is the reality here?
NATO is a military alliance composed of 28 countries.
Hence, the US runs most NATO civilian and military commands with the consent of the others.
NATO was founded to confront the threat that the USSR represented 60 years ago.
To that end, all members must stand on an equal footing.
An Arab “Third Way”
The result is very weak competition among the players left.
Competition policy was attuned to deal with individual crises, but a systemic crisis has almost broken its back.
It is precisely the size and power of large financial, automotive, and other firms that have conditioned the scope of regulation and public intervention.
An Arab Spring?
Indeed, the wall of fear has crumbled, the people have spoken, and an “Arab spring” could be at hand.
Given this, it would seem wrong, if not dangerous, to compare Tunisia and its Jasmine Revolution to other national contexts in the region.
And Morocco, contrary to Algeria, does not suffer from the curse of oil.
Hence, the West need not bear any responsibility for the outcome.
Their ability to do so confirms that Iran is not a closed totalitarian state like North Korea.
In the Iranian worldview, there are three great ancient Asian civilizations: Chinese, Indian, and Persian (with Persia being the greatest).
Iranians expect to perform on par with China and India.
An Assassination in Belgrade
Djindjic himself narrowly escaped a highway assassination attempt only last month.
As Serbia's prime minister after Milosevic, he resembled a corporate CEO more than the Heidelberg-educated philosophy professor that he was.
As a result of Serbia's predicament, he accumulated more power than prime ministers typically wield.
Only prosperity and a "European Serbia" mattered.
But the one certain success of Djindjic's era is that they will never return to power.
But the Sichuan earthquake was not completely irrelevant to China’s political progress.
A more open and transparent public environment will help awaken their sense of political mission.
Italy’s new leadership must sustain this progress.
Navigating it will require Italy to retain its credibility with other European Union member states and international investors.
A Scandinavian level of taxes would be bearable if public services did not remain inferior to those offered in Scandinavia.
An Egyptian Sakharov
Prof. Ibrahim was sentenced to seven years imprisonment.
But it is the EU that is proving most complicit.
But, with a “Texas oil man” in the White House, it won’t happen.
An Epidemic of Politics
Well, it isn't standard practice in America - or at least it wasn't.
But study sections?
Nothing is gained - and much is lost - when a desired policy outcome is put first.
They can do so very easily: by following the law.
An Honest Man?
Rice said that "the statement that [Bush] made was indeed accurate.
The British government did say that."
So the IMF now finds itself at the center of the economic universe once again.
How will it choose to deploy its newfound power?
That’s similar to what the world experienced over the past 150 years.
Gore has helped the world to worry.
The IPCC engages in meticulous research where facts rule over everything else.
An India-China Axis?
The rise of China is a major factor in the politics of the twenty-first century.
But a return to the 1967 borders would mean that large settlement blocks – as well as smaller settlements and East Jerusalem – would be part of the Palestinians state.
Non-violent protest has also been on the rise, whereas violent acts and suicide bombings have been drastically decreased.
An Inequality Tax
One such opportunity was missed in the early 1990’s.
But the same or a similar approach could be taken in many countries today, from Angola to Zimbabwe.
The operation's success was no accident.
But widespread sharing is not always needed or appropriate.
Still, I am not complacent.
As requested by the European Council, I am developing, in cooperation with the European Commission, a strategy to shut down terrorist financing.
But ESDP is not at the core of our efforts.
The EU will be tough on terrorism.
These are not two fights, but one.
He has experienced unthinkable trauma, and is still exposed to it.
Could a person of color win power in other white-majority countries?
An Old Problem on China’s New Frontier
In fact, the latter seems to be the price paid for the success of the former.
This is not a novel phenomenon.
In the longer term, however, the Chinese authorities have every reason to be worried: Xinjiang will grow to be a problem like Tibet.
Come to think of it: whatever happened to the Poles, whom Russia so successfully put down in 1863?
An Open Letter to Ehud Olmert
On a much smaller scale, significant change has been taking place on the Palestinian side as well.
As a start, priority must be given to face-to-face negotiations.

The Uses of Nuclear Ambitions
The problem is that it remains a departure without any meaningful destination.
Anatomy of a Crisis
Similarly, eliminating Glass-Steagall was fundamentally sensible.
As a stand-alone entity, it was then vulnerable to market swings.
Much of it went into US treasuries and the obligations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
As they absorb their losses on US treasury and agency securities, capital flows toward the US will diminish.
We are not going to change human nature.
Anatomy of a Financial Meltdown
NEW YORK – A vicious circle is currently underway in the United States, and its reach could broaden to the global economy.
Indeed, adding up all these losses in financial markets, the sum will hit a staggering $1 trillion.
In recent years, public attitudes in Iran have become more liberal.
Generally, Ahmadinejad begins his public speeches with prayers for the Mahdi’s immediate return.
Worldwide broadcasts of the beating and killing of protesters have undermined the regime’s religious credentials.
Anatomy of Chavez
Anatomy of Fear
How does your brain form its most significant memories?
The core of the brain's fear system is found in a region called the "amygdala".
There is also evidence that amygdala of reptiles and birds have similar functions.
While this is undoubtedly true of the human brain, it is not at all clear which (if any) other animals have this capacity.
At the same time, you will be reminded of the accident, will remember where you were going, who you were with, and other details.
Many of the most common psychiatric disorders that afflict humans are emotional disorders; many of these are related to the brain's fear system.
Anatomy of Thatcherism
Indeed, even beyond the political left, the Anglo-American model of capitalism is deemed to have failed.
All we have are comparisons between what happened at different times.
The most notorious symptom of this was the emergence of “stagflation” – simultaneously rising inflation and unemployment.
Nigel Lawson was Thatcher’s second Chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister.
It was right to encourage a new economy to grow outside these congealed structures.
Political pendulums often swing too far.
Anatomy of the Party of Power
Or are surprises in store for Putin?
And Free Flows the Nile
After all, Egypt is the heart, brain, and nerve center of the Arab world.
Ancient Arab lands are bestirred.
Will this yearning travel beyond the Nile, as it did from Tunis to Cairo?
But it is not only the fate of Israel that has now shocked US policy, in particular, to its core.
The Egypt-Israel peace treaty has kept Egypt comfortably neutralized, freeing the US to commit its strategic resources elsewhere.
Many are fed up with the arbitrary imposition of trade barriers – affecting goods ranging from chocolate to steel pipes – in their former Soviet markets.
The EU says that those terms are unacceptable.
Any subsequent legal reform in Ukraine would appear hollow.
The corruption and lawlessness that characterizes Yanukovych’s Ukraine should spur the EU to hold fast both to the letter and the spirit of its conditions.
Time is not on Yanukovych’s side.
The European Council of Ministers will make its final decision on November 18.
Yanukovych will be the one blocking Ukraine’s path to the future.
The Humanities Crisis
NEW YORK – A striking symmetry is emerging in debates about the future of higher education around the world.
Hong Kong University, for example, has extended its undergraduate programs from three years to four.
For example:
Yale University and the National University of Singapore have worked together to establish Yale-NUS, Singapore’s first liberal arts college.
More than half of this amount was already emitted by 2011.
We need people on both sides of the Vistula River to do their part to build a fair and ambitious universal climate agreement by 2015.
Self-assertion became the watchword of German foreign policy.
On the European project, she is as committed to integration as her predecessors have been.
George H.W. Bush was faulted (and faulted himself) for not having what he called “the vision thing.”
At the same time, the pressure to articulate a vision can get a leader into difficulty.
What plays well with one group may not sit well with another.
They must be able to assess reality accurately.
Jolie’s announcement has thrown a spotlight on that issue.
Bringing the Iran Deal Back Home
Another Argentine History
On top of Argentina’s bestseller list isThe Myths of Argentine History, Volume Two.
In second place isThe Myths of Argentine History, Volume One.
Argentina had been, since the end of the nineteenth century, the country of the future.
The new land offered them the promise of a magnificent tomorrow.
For the individual, Argentina embodied the dream that one’s children would live better – and their children even better.
It lasted for nearly a century, until the early 1980’s.
Argentina has become a country without direction.
Never before has America, the world’s biggest consumer, been so weak for so long.
In fact, Asia became more reliant on exports and external demand for economic growth.
That inattention will end soon; a decision about the province’s fate is looming.
Talks continue, but, as UN negotiator and former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari diplomatically told the Security Council, they are effectively dead.
No Serbian leader will agree to Kosovo’s independence, because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country.
Kosovo’s ethnic Albanians have proclaimed that they will not accept any tie to Serbia, no matter how tenuous.
Throughout the 1990’s, they virtually opted out of Serbian-run Kosovo by creating parallel institutions.
The nature of the independence bestowed is also important.
Moreover, the government has encouraged the leaders of Bosnia’s Republika Srpska to threaten to hold their own referendum on separation from a still fragile Bosnia.
That tactic may be working.
Another European Failure
Its total impotence to prevent war near the heart of Europe was amply proved in Bosnia and Kosovo over the last decade.
The European Union continued to produce words.
This is exactly what the Austrian conservative People's Party under Wolfgang Schuessel did not do.
What is Brussels to do?

Another Failed British Experiment
FLORENCE – British politics has always been something of an experimental laboratory for the industrialized world.
Britain was the coolest place on earth, boasting the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the pastel fashions of Carnaby Street.
Which group should be the first to make a sacrifice?
In the 2000’s boom, as in the 1960’s, it looked as if everyone could live on the never-never.
Another Fine Italian Mess
With public debt expected to stand at 102% of GDP in 2009, rising inflation, and growth of just 0.2%, it will be difficult to keep electoral promises.
Plans to build a high-speed train connecting Italy with northern Europe continue to experience delays.
The garbage crisis in Naples remains unresolved putting the international reputation of one of Italy’s most famous products, mozzarella, at risk.
A similar choice was made on the left by Veltroni, whose Democratic Party is now allied with Antonio Di Pietro’s Italy of Values Party.
The American dollar soared, the Japanese yen went into orbit, the euro fell to earth, and the British pound crashed, leaving a giant crater.
But times are hardly normal.
Commodity currencies had to come off their meteoric highs.
In one sense it has been answered: the United Nations is and will continue to be involved, and the United States has and will continue to play the leading role.
Containment of Iraq by intervention is the method that now seems most likely.
So what is the problem?
In the 1950s, the answer was simple: Europeans should never go to war against each other again.
But how is this identity to be defined?
In fact, the Jews are, of course,not a race, but then neither are whites, blacks, mulattos, Indians, gypsies, Arabs, or any other subgroup of human beings.
The recently completed sequencing of the human genome proved the existence of but a single race: the human race.
The Court made short shrift of Ellwanger's claim, becauseall human beings can be the victims of racism.
The practices of racism are historical, political, and cultural phenomena.

The EU’s embassies in Havana will now craft their guest lists in accordance with the Cuban government’s wishes.
That means that tomorrow it could bid for contracts to build missile bases on the coast of the People’s Republic of China.
Where will it end?
Denying a visa to Russian human rights activist Sergey Kovalyov?
An apology to Saddam Hussein?
The opening of peace talks with Al Qaida?
Appeasing Serbia
We know how that plan ended.
John F. Kennedy was in the Metternich mold.
Of course, North Korea is not early-nineteenth century France or the USSR of 1962.
Precious time was squandered before North Korea’s first nuclear test in 2006.
Arab Fathers and Sons
At present, four political generations co-exist on the region’s socio-political map.
The next generation was born between 1935 and 1955, and in many respects represents a generation “in between.”
But it is the fourth group that underscores the relevance of generational issues in the Arab world.
Even when combined, the first three generations make up barely one-third of the entire Arab population.
Arab Fathers and Sons
Arab Myths and Realities
Arabs don’t go into the street.
Elections equal democracy.
The international community has no role to play.
Admiral Mike Mullen, the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently defined America’s colossal fiscal deficits as the biggest threat to its national security.
Security, they maintain, means more than defense.
Arafat\u0027s Ghost
An independent Palestinian state that did not include all of Israel held no appeal to him.
In the meantime, however, Hamas is willing to form alliances with the nationalists, particularly the militant faction of Fatah.
Arafat not only left no successor, but no order.
Arafat’s Last Hurrrah
Everything about the man was, indeed, protracted.
He carried out a protracted war of national liberation.
But there is much more to Arafat’s legacy than endurance.
It was Yasir Arafat, through the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) he founded, that gave them a sense of identity as a people.
Internationally, however, he was out of step with the post Cold War era.
It is Arafat’s last hurrah.
Are Bad Banks a Good Idea?
The Swedish bank cleanup in the early 1990’s is often cited as an example of how successful this idea can be.
A government-sponsored bad bank for private assets is thus a very bad idea.
All subsidies should be transparent, and public/private bad banks are not.
Here, Sweden’s experience is encouraging.
Certainly that is what Congressmen in the US, and Members of Parliament in the UK think.
We just don’t know yet whether the crisis will cause another reversion to the mean, but some downward adjustment looks likely.
So there is some basis for saying they are overpaid, but why?
Politicians and regulators are exploring a number of options, from higher tax rates, through fines for certain types of bonus arrangements, to variable capital requirements.
Higher taxes may be justified for other reasons, but are unlikely to solve the problem described.
Shouldn’t shareholders take more of an interest?
Are Foreign Investors Still Welcome?
Of the 219 known international arbitration cases concerning investment projects, some two-thirds were initiated during the past three years.
The first big city to boom was London, starting around 1996.
Boom mentality spread to Los Angeles, New York, and Sydney around 1997, to Paris in 1998, to Miami, Moscow, and Shanghai in 2001, and Vancouver around 2002.
In Sydney, home prices actually fell in the second quarter.
Has the boom ended?
First, the world economy does look more chaotic than it did a decade ago.
So, where does this leave us?
Are Human Rights Universal?
Besides, which country can claim to be following its pure "traditional culture"?
Development is about change, but repression prevents change.
Freedom from torture?
The authentic voices of the South know how to cry out in pain.
But, as I argued then, the development of reason could take us in a different direction.
Yet, on the other hand, reason is more than a neutral problem-solving tool.
Many people will doubt this claim.
Pinker accepts that reason is an important factor underlying the trends that he describes.
One theory is that we have gotten better at IQ tests because we live in a more symbol-rich environment.
Flynn himself thinks that the spread of the scientific mode of reasoning has played a role.
What, then, is responsible for global warming so far?
But this does not mean that human emissions are responsible for the growing accumulation of atmospheric CO2.
However, there is also an estimated exchange of 90 Gt per year between the atmosphere and the oceans.
This equilibrium is, in turn, determined by the temperature of ocean surface water.
On the available evidence, then, skeptics of the Kyoto Treaty appear to have a powerful case.
But [it] produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance.”
But, on the Global Peace Index, it is ranked 88th of 153 countries.
Violence is conspicuously absent from the list.
Skyscrapers rise out of the desert, yet women are not permitted to ride with men in their lifts.
Nor are they allowed to walk in the streets, drive a car, or leave the country without the permission of a male guardian.
But, within two days of her detention, 500,000 viewers had watched the YouTube video of her excursion.
Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that forbids women to drive cars.
Religious education constitutes up to 50% of students’ curriculum.
We have been here before, though.
This was an unpalatable conclusion.
Are the Barbarians at the EU Gates?
Failure is not an option.”
Are the Dollar\u0027s Days Numbered?
Currently, the US dollar remains dominant.
Since 1980, however, the dollar has lost ground.
The Deutsche Mark's share remained relatively unchanged between 1980 and 1995.
But firms also care about what their competitors do.
Second, even when selling to countries other than the US, Japanese exporters often face stiff American competition.
To be sure, in all four countries, religiosity is widespread, with more than 90% of respondents collectively reporting that they believe in God, in life after death, and in heaven and hell.
A strong current of liberalism appeared in the late nineteenth century in Ottoman Syria in response to the religious despotism of Sultan Abdulhamid.
Whenever war is invoked, it implies a fight against nations, peoples, or states.
But this reading is largely wishful thinking by those who support secession.
The Canadian judges held that international law granted no such unilateral right (and nor did the country's own constitution).
Are We Running Out of Oil (Again)?
That is how markets work.
For example, in 1972, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, including computer pioneer Jay Forrester, published The Limits to Growth .
Are We Still Evolving?
What have we learned?
Some scientists, myself included, have taken a different approach.
Some of the answers are surprising.
The women were born between 1892 and 1956.
So what is going on here?
Three things:
But genes are only one of many factors that influence height and age at first birth.
Are We Working Ourselves to Death?
Work can give structure and meaning to life.
This has numerous implications for relations with employees.
But the numbers remain very small.
The question is how.
If you are a closed and inward-looking country, you are bound to need lots of psychologists.
Argentina: Stuck in a Time Warp
Political and economic reforms over the past decade were supposed to lead the country out of chronic economic crisis.
But Argentina’s woes go deeper.
America, for example, invests around $90 billion of public funds each year in scientific research.
Sadly, Argentina did not.
Under-investment in technology is evident throughout the economy.
Argentine inventors received just 63 patents in the US in the year 2000, compared with 3,400 patents received by Korean inventors.
But Argentina did not make a successful transformation from a resource-based to a technology-based economy.
Argentina’s Bumpy Ride
Neighboring Brazil helped by undergoing a boom of its own, which pumped up demand for a wide range of Argentine products.
You would not feel any such anxiety in Buenos Aires shopping malls, which are as crowded as ever.
Even former creditors benefited from this rebound.
Indeed, lenders are supposed to be experts on risk management and assessment, and in that sense, the onus should be on them.
The repercussions of this miscarriage of justice may be felt for a long time.
Argentina\u0027s Lessons
Other mistakes in Argentina's ``reform'' program also occurred.
East Asia's crisis of 1997 provided the first hit.
But with 20% interest rates, 9% of the country's GDP would be spent annually on financing its debt.
Fiscal austerity was supposed to restore confidence.
But in Argentina's democracy, this was impossible.
Seven lessons must now be drawn:
The story goes back decades.
This system is known as a “currency board” arrangement.
Argentine wages and prices rose significantly from 1991 through 1993.
Few listened.
Automobile manufacturers with divided production between Argentina and Brazil shifted production to Brazilian factories.
Bond rating agencies downgraded Argentina’s government debt, which contributed to a further rise in the risk premium.
In Argentina, unlike in the US, re-election is unlimited, as long as the president does not exceed two consecutive periods in office.
Néstor Kirchner doesn’t joke.
Instead, he busies himself with organizing a political movement that will structure his project.
Corruption remains.
It is a significant achievement.
For example, even though the United States was at the heart of the financial crisis, the dollar initially soared.
It is hard to see why right now.
But, in 2011, most of the equilibration will likely take place through inflation.
Arming the Asylum
In 1999, the scene was nearby Columbine High School.
By some estimates, there are more than 20 mass shootings per year in the United States.
And always the same question: Why?
Few legislators – Democrats and Republicans alike – care to take on the National Rifle Association.
This is a far less common sight in countries with functioning mental-health systems.
Inpatient care, too, has been slashed.
Congress created the Fed, which means that Congress can un-create it.
Artificial Intelligence and Globalization
My portal to the world of artificial intelligence is a narrow one: the more than 500-year-old game of chess.
Chess has long been the centerpiece of research in artificial intelligence.
It is only a slight exaggeration to say there are more possible moves in a chess game than atoms in a universe.
For most of the twentieth century, programmers were patently unsuccessful in designing chess computers that could compete with the best humans.
The computers gradually improved, but they still seemed far inferior to the top humans.
But the IBM team had not cheated.
The “Turing test” is the holy grail of artificial intelligence research.
Well, for me, a chess game is a conversation of sorts.
But the level that computers have reached already is scary enough.
Are we so sure that it will be different in this century?
As China Gains, Will Southern Africa?
By contrast, southern Africa is beset with problems.
But China’s rise also holds risks for southern Africa.
As China Turns
Initially she follows in her older sister’s footsteps in quest of their common dream, to attend one of China’s top universities.
She is tempted by the shortcut Song promises and allows herself to be seduced by him in turn for a large sum of cash and luxury apartment.
Song certainly knows how “to catch mice”!
The program has caused a tsunami of online reflection.
Indeed, while Song may be cast as an anti-hero, in contemporary China, he is considered a “good catch.”
The Portuguese economy is now expected to contract by 1% in 2013.
ASEAN’s New Approach to Myanmar
The ASEAN effort coincides with two other developments.
Consider, too, the junta’s gesture in handing over Yettaw to Senator Webb, and its interaction with the international community on humanitarian assistance after Cyclone Nargis.
Japan, too – still the largest Asian economy and a traditional donor to the region – must also play a role.
Asia After Obama
A fast-rising Asia has, moreover, become the fulcrum of global geopolitical change.
In the process, Burma has become more dependent than ever on China.
Asia Enters the Storm
Reverberations are already evident in other emerging Asian economies that depend on exports both to China-based manufacturers and to the US and Europe.
So, even with rebalancing, exports will remain a significant determinant of their growth, and China is already their major export market.
That was then.
This is a big deal for Asia.
That seemed like a good move.
Asia in the Balance
Nevertheless, strategic anxiety lurks below the surface, particularly in India.
After independence in 1947, India followed an inward-looking policy that focused on heavy industry.
India has an emerging middle class of several hundred million, and English is an official language, spoken by 50-100 million people.
Asia in the World
While I was foreign minister of the Republic of Korea, my Government and I strongly advocated détente with the North.
That requires listening as well as speaking.
This remains my style at the United Nations.
We are doing that now in Myanmar.
You expect nothing.
We are at this point in Darfur.
We are the only continent where regional integration and common markets have not taken hold.
The African Union aspires to become a United States of Africa.
Central to Asia’s future is the strategic triangle made up of China, India, and Japan.
But in Asia, the wars since 1950 failed to resolve disputes.
Today, they need to find ways to reconcile their interests in Asia so that they can coexist peacefully and prosper.
The Philippines and Taiwan have chosen new presidents; India and Malaysia have ushered in new parliaments and prime ministers.
This seems especially true when a government tries to enact radical economic or political reforms.
Of course, parliamentary political systems are far from perfect.
This means that governments are judged not by their ability to outmaneuver legislatures, but by the quality of their policies.
This seems especially true when a government tries to enact radical economic or political reforms.
Of course, parliamentary political systems are far from perfect.
This means that governments are judged not by their ability to outmaneuver legislatures, but by the quality of their policies.
For Abraham Lincoln was right: a house divided against itself cannot stand.
Asia’s Hard Road
Given current global economic uncertainties, there is no room for this kind of disruption.
Developing a vibrant service sector is also crucial.
Suzlon Energy, an Indian company started in 1995 with just 20 people, has become one of the world’s leading wind power companies, with offices in 21 countries.
Suntech, a Chinese company founded in 2001, is the third largest manufacturer of solar cells in the world.
And the clock is ticking.
Today, Earth’s atmosphere already contains 380 parts per million of CO2.
The Maldives will likely disappear entirely.
Asia’s Fragile Special Relationship
NEW DELHI – “Tzu-Ch’in asked Tzu-Kung a few questions; Tzu-Kung answered: …Our Master gets things (done) by being cordial, frank, courteous, temperate, deferential.
That is our…way.”
The world has a variety of “special relationships.”
Indeed, around Gilgit in Kashmir, China’s People’s Liberation Army has greatly enhanced its troop presence.
Instead, it remains focused on Northeast Asia, Tibet, Taiwan, and on its aspirations to move into the Indian Ocean, that great global highway of trade in the twenty-first century.
Asia’s Hour?
This would help all economies.
If the twenty-first century is to be the Asia-Pacific century, they must be.
NEW HAVEN – Asia has an inflation problem.
Benchmark policy rates are currently below headline inflation in India, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia.
They are only slightly positive in China, Taiwan, and Malaysia.
Although their current combined GDP is still a relatively small fraction of global output (about 15%), that share is rising rapidly.
The old model won’t work.
This time, the impetus has been provided by China’s increasingly muscular foreign policy.
Japan, America’s treaty ally, has established military interoperability only with US forces.
India for example, cannot be a Japan to the US.
Indeed, the US has worked to co-opt India in a “soft alliance” devoid of treaty obligations.
Approximately 1,000 Japanese forces serve in and around Iraq.
It is a question of when, not if, the Japanese amend Article IX of their constitution, which limits the role of Japan’s armed forces to self-defense.
But more is needed.
Exchanges of every kind – military, educational, touristic – should be facilitated.
The Franco-German relationship, central to much twentieth-century conflict, now forms the core of modern Europe.
And yet, even with damage to infrastructure such as road and rail links, the tsunamis’ overall economic impact is expected to be minor.
Historical experience incites this suspicion.
It beggars belief that China and India are not members of the G-7.
This mindset is also pervasive in Western governments, industry, business schools, and the media.
Yet I took away a different conclusion from Davos.
Real GDP in South Korea – long considered the darling of Asia’s newly industrialized economies – contracted by 5.7% that year.
Weaker banks merged with stronger rivals, or combined to form new, stronger entities under state supervision.
His actions toward HBOS and RBS show that his government is prepared to take control, not just equity.
Asian Footsteps in Africa
Some years ago, I witnessed his early experiments with rural telemedicine, especially in the Indian states of Karnataka and West Bengal.
India tried to mimic the event, with an India-Africa summit in New Delhi in 2008.
Fourteen countries attended to discuss food price inflation, energy needs, etc.
Gandhi and the Non-Aligned Movement remain important symbols.
Indians are more part of Africa’s social tapestry than are the Chinese, a fabric that has been strengthened through opportunity and adversity through the ages.
The Olam and Wilmar joint venture is, in a sense, symptomatic of the combination of assets from across Asia that can catalyze productive change in Africa.
It is fitting that Olam, in Hebrew, means “transcending boundaries.”
Such symbiosis requires a healthy disregard for convention.
Asian Nationalism at Sea
CAMBRIDGE – Will war break out in the seas of East Asia?
One should not be too alarmist.
The Chinese Communist Party is not very communist any more.
So far only the Netherlands, Belgium, and the state of Oregon in the US have put explicit legislation into practice.
Should, for instance, the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease qualify?
And what about people whose reason for wanting to die is not related to their medical condition at all?
In public discussions there is often a presumption that it is the task of the medical profession.
In this respect, the Death with Dignity Act in Oregon is an interesting law.
In Oregon, the patient decides independently of the physician where and when he or she wants to die, or even at all.
At Home in Guantánamo Bay
GUANTÁNAMO BAY – I write this from the United States Detention Center at Guantánamo Bay, where I have been held without charge for almost seven years.
My detention here is the result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
It is not safe for me to go home.
Uzbekistan, a former Soviet Republic, is a poor country without many employment opportunities.
After several months of job hunting, I joined my brother in a business venture buying and selling apples, honey, and other goods in neighboring Tajikistan.
Unfortunately, there were some in Tajikistan who didn’t like having a bunch of Uzbeks living in their country.
But they didn’t.
I am not alone.
But how big and dangerous is that risk?
Atlas Slumps
Not likely.
Until now.
Similarly, whatever spending increases the US Congress approves this fall will not have significant effects on government spending until the summer and fall of 2004.
As French cities have burned, other countries have been very severe in judging France.
Minority youth are, to be sure, over-represented among those involved.
In the current violence, the police have unfortunately been placed in the position of sole representative of the state.
There should be a European growth strategy, rather than Spanish, Italian, or Irish strategies.
Aside from wringing their hands, what should governments be doing?
But it is wrong to think that massive accumulation of debt is a free lunch.
The last thing the Portuguese or Greek armies want to do is assume responsibility for governing.
These differences were not trivial.
After the colonels’ junta there fell in 1974, a democratic system sprang up.
The center-right New Democracy has also lost ground, though not as badly.
Austerity and the Modern Banker
So they are walking away with a great deal of cash.
The protesters of “Occupy Albany” issued a powerful consensus statement recently, which reads in part:
Germany’s surplus, at $216 billion, is now larger than China’s – and the world’s largest in absolute terms.
But this interpretation of the Great Depression, common though it is, is misguided.
Great Britain in 1931 already grasped this logic.
The country was no longer subject to imported deflation via the fixed exchange rate.
But developing and implementing a social-protection floor takes time, and governments do not seem to be willing to wait.
BRUSSELS – Europe seems to be obsessed with austerity.
For these countries, the confidence fairy has become a monster.
Austria: Values and Responsibilities
Last Thursday, judges at Indonesia's Central Jakarta Court sentenced me to one year in prison.
For the first few years after Sukarno's fall in 1966, all the benefits of genuine democracy, including freedom of the press, were restored (except for the communists).
Since Suharto's fall in 1998, Indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the largest democratic Muslim community in history.
Democracy's enemies, however, never rest.
Automatic Savers
People are fascinated by wealth.
But, mostly, they don’t even think about that possibility.
The contribution rate for the Central Provident Fund is now 34.5% for people with higher incomes.
The soldiers are portrayed as being manipulated by their leaders – through vicious racism and religious derision – into brutal action against the non-aggressive “hostiles.”
The indigenous people are an amalgam of echoes from all the great wars of empire that have troubled the recent American conscience.
They respect their environment, whereas the Americans must “return to a dying planet,” because, as the indigenous people put it, “they have killed their own mother.”
Blue Jeans?
They will never leave the Hometree [their sacred land].
Without a viable legal system, foreign investment will remain elusive.
The market thus punished bad risks.
In some cases, as in the Ottoman Empire or Egypt, creditors restructured finances by force or the threat of it.
Argentina, for example, reached a voluntarily negotiated agreement in 1893.
After Russia's crisis of 1901, investors turned to the US and Australia.
Latin America had a big debt crisis that broke out in 1982, but in fact there were almost no defaults (with the exception of Peru and, for a few months in late 1987, Brazil).
But in the second half of the 1990's, this system began to unravel.
In the 21st century, we are returning to the ways of the 19th century.
Back to the Great Game in Kazakhstan
Kazakhstan already plays a key role in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a group that comprises Central Asian countries, along with Russia and China.
Some years ago the historian Fritz Stern wrote a book about Germany entitled The Politics of Cultural Despair.
For Stern, this was part of the cultural soil in which National Socialism flourished.
In a different way, this is true of Italy as well.
So do their consequences.
Backing the Right Horse in Pakistan
This outcome undermined those in Turkey who had promoted human-rights reforms.
Bailout Blues
We could do more with less money.
The Scandinavian countries showed the way two decades ago.
That way, the debt/GDP ratio declines because the denominator (economic output) increases, not because the numerator (the total the government has borrowed) declines.
But that should be okay, especially if we all have jobs.
Balancing Asia\u0027s Rivals
There are now more than 80,000 Indian students studying in the US, and many have stayed to establish successful companies.
We can’t both be right.”
Balancing China’s High Savings
Such an example captures China’s recent economic situation.
Balancing the World’s Imbalances
They all agree that resolving these imbalances is in each of their interests.
Under the UN Charter, all five must endorse the election of every Secretary-General.
In that capacity, I see the Secretary-General in action in all parts of the world.
Not many.
Though the political process has since stalled, he has pushed for more peacekeepers and helicopters.
His campaign has already helped to reduce the incidence of malaria.
In 1999, Huji members attempted to assassinate the moderate poet Shamshur Rahman with an axe.
For example, during Ramadan prayers last October, a mob of a 1,000 people razed a mosque of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community.
Hindus, Ahmadiyyas, and tribal people in the Chittagong hills, fearful for their safety, have been leaving the country in droves.
The atmosphere of violence is palpable in other ways.
The killers have never been apprehended.
With EU support worth €18 million, this operation will improve food security for around 860,000 rural households, or more than six million people.
The problem goes beyond deliberate obfuscation.
Bankers without Borders
Even if it were a remote possibility, the 2008 financial crisis has taught us that rare events occur.
This institution should be an international version of the US Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Code.
Takeover by an international organization has three advantages over a domestic solution.
The IMF would be better.
The trigger should be the domestic government itself.
Unfortunately, in the international arena these two conditions are almost never met.
Bankruptcy Comes to China
Up to now, some 2,520 agencies and 388 individuals have been included on the list of receivers.
This ideal grew out of Andrew Jackson’s titanic struggle with Nicholas Biddle and the Second Bank of the United States.
As a result, most nineteenth-century US banks did not have branches, and were limited to one state.
By 1931, even Britain found it hard to resist the German model.
Israel’s non-military settlements are, and have always been, irrelevant to the country’s security.
But there are 250,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
He also proves his profound friendship for the Jewish state.
The bottom chessboard is the realm of transnational relations that cross borders outside of government control.
It also includes new challenges like pandemics and climate change.
In inter-state politics, the most important factor will be the continuing “return of Asia.”
By 2040, Asia will be well on its way back to its historical share.
Exceptional periods sometimes create exceptional leaders.
Without the French Revolution, Napoleon Bonaparte would have remained a gifted and frustrated junior military officer.
The silent majority is ready to be convinced that there is life after Bush.
Power in America shifted first from the East Coast to the West Coast, and then to the South.
Of course, to reduce Obama to the color of his skin is a grave oversimplification, even if he has been keen to emphasize his “black roots.”
But Obama can learn from the early mistakes made by Jimmy Carter in the mid-1970’s.
Jimmy Carter Obama
PARIS – “How many divisions does the Pope have?” Joseph Stalin famously quipped when told to be mindful of the Vatican.
Carter was a somewhat bland engineer, whereas Obama is a charismatic lawyer.
They could not guarantee our souls.
Barbarians at the Gate?
This is a decisive novelty.
In the past, Europe's political contests were waged between left wing parties representing the interests of labor, and right wing parties representing the interests of capital.
The successes of populist/right wing parties can largely be attributed to the failures of left-leaning governments.
Negotiations for enlargement are still under way.
Barbarians or Geniuses at the Gate?
The most successful countries in this regard have been the Anglo-Saxon countries (Canada, Ireland, Australia, the United States, and the UK, in that order), as well as Denmark and Norway.
The brain drain to the Anglo-Saxon countries, the US in particular, is astounding.
The idea is not new.
Barroso Overboard?
BRUSSELS – It is time for José Manuel Barroso to start selling himself.
That seeming passivity is now his greatest problem.
What is to be done?
This time, he must produce one if he is to save his skin.
Today, Russian President Vladimir Putin has advanced an even more ambitious goal: “a common market stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific.”
As a result, the European project itself could be called into question.
The institutional integration of Russia into greater Europe will require strong commitment from both sides.
Bear Hunting in Romania
This day, I was told by a forester who claimed to have witnessed the incident, Ceausescu did not acknowledge the applause of his retainers.
This could be the story of the Romanian revolution, 20 years ago.
The bear is the country’s enslaved people.
Just as the glory of the French Revolution ended in the Terror, so Eastern Europe’s miracle year of 1989 ended in blood.
Not so in Romania.
A civil war was fought, albeit briefly.
It began in mid-December in the gritty industrial town of Timisoara, close to the Hungarian border.
The rest is well-known history.
From the rear of the huge crowd came shouts: “Ti-mi-soara!
Snipers shot from the rooftops, and tanks blasted away in what today is Revolution Square, setting the national library ablaze.
I sensed this arriving in Bucharest on December 26.
I could understand the poets, students, dissidents, and allegedly disaffected government officials.
But Gen. Stefan Gruse, the army chief of staff who commanded the troops in Timisoara?
The newly appointed president, Ion Iliescu, who was Ceausescu’s former chief propagandist?
In the short run, it is technically difficult to adjust consumption.
Interest rates are traditionally low in Switzerland.
This is why central banks are now searching for new instruments.
Quantitative easing represents one such attempt.
This is why the Swiss move comes as a surprise.
Beggaring the World Economy
CHICAGO – Global capital is on the move.
Others have been imposing capital controls of one stripe or another.
Countries can overspend for a variety of reasons.
There are exceptions.
After all, beggar-thy-neighbor policies will succeed only in making us all beggars.
But let me focus on Bernanke’s fourth statement.
There is no analogous set of floodlights being deployed to erase the shadow that is currently being cast by the lesser depression.
By the late 1990’s, however, it had had enough.
Berlin, Birthplace of Modern Asia
Another defining event in 1989 was the Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy protestors in Beijing.
But you don't win in TV and the real estate business without the right political connections.
On the other hand, political connections do not make a politician.
So he decided that he needed to become his own political sponsor.
Italy is in economic decline.
Fiat's crisis may see the country lose its last great internationally competitive industrial enterprise. 
In fact, however, Berlusconi represents political extremism and programmatic ambiguity. 
The Prime Minister often speaks about pension reform, but has failed to offer any new proposals.
Instead, he backs a plan by a group of Italian financiers to pry control of Fiat from the dominance of the Agnelli family.
Growing numbers of people, even moderates, are moving into active opposition.
After three years in office, he has not delivered on his economic agenda and his government is in shambles.
·  The Mezzogiorno . Labor productivity is traditionally much lower in Italy's south than in the rest of the country.
MILAN – A winter election is not to Italian tastes.
As the economist Marco Fortis points out, Italian family wealth is still, if not for long, second to none in Europe.
In this context, a new wealth tax could be a dangerous proposition for the PD.
Bernanke Meets the Press
Many savvy Wall Street traders are convinced that QE is just the old “Greenspan put” on steroids.
Are traders right?
Better Red than Dead?
The problem is that attitudes towards healthcare are fundamentally different.
Roughly 250,000 hip replacements are performed in the US each year.
Under-60 patients are becoming more important as newer artificial joints prove their capacity to withstand more active lifestyles.
If Tour de France officials think they have big problems now with steroids, just wait ten years.
Better than Basel
Betting the House
They are just buying real estate because they need it.
We hope to facilitate the creation of such markets in other countries as well.
Over the next decade, we might expect that a broad spectrum of insurance, lending, and securities companies will become involved.
Betting With the House’s Money
Including interest payments on past deficits, the tab for 2006 alone was over $800 billion dollars – roughly 6.5% of US gross national product.
Equity holdings are somewhat more concentrated, but many middle class Americans have still benefited indirectly through their pension funds.
The Kenyan authorities, eager to please the US, were tempted to hand over Kenyan citizens on the slightest encouragement.
A demonstration by Nigerian Muslims in Kano against the US war in Afghanistan provoked stone throwing by Nigerian Christians.
Churches and mosques were soon being burned in communal riots.
There was a time when it was called "Mvita," the Isle of War.
But when even a lone elephant does a war dance, the grass still feels the pain.
Hence the strengthening of the active screening mechanism of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US.
Beware of Symbols
Argentina trades with Brazil, America with Japan.
Until 1999, everything seemed to prove Domingo Cavallo right.
That combination was lethal.
The national debt-GDP ratio is less than 60 %, which is the average within the European Union.
The Fund has little leverage over the big countries that are at the heart of the problem.
It wouldn’t be the first time.
Beyond Bin Laden
That icon has now been destroyed.
Terrorism is a decentralized phenomenon – in its funding, planning, and execution.
There are successors, starting with Ayman al-Zawahiri in Al Qaeda, as well as in autonomous groups operating out of Yemen, Somalia, and other countries.
We want to do better.
The answer is to be found in the realm of prevention.
Most terrorists today are young and male.
Training to respond to severe accidents was inadequate.
The International Atomic Energy Agency expects at least 90 additional nuclear-power reactors to join the 437 now in operation globally by 2030.
Nuclear safety is of the utmost importance to both established users and newcomers.
Complacency can be deadly.
Beyond Pandemics
Governments, international organizations, and people around the world are rightly focused on fighting it.
They take fewer days off work.
In Africa, the ratio is 900 per 100,000.
Yes, the world faces its first influenza pandemic in more than 40 years.
We must remain on guard against changes in the virus.
Of course, paradise never comes, and – naturally - disappointment follows.
Some of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s statements seem to recall the Soviet era with nostalgia.
Ukraine belongs to a united European political entity; the values that Ukraine endorses and that are embedded in its history are European to the core.
But in principle, Ukraine can succeed as well.
Much the same is true for Ukraine and NATO.
In other words, NATO membership, like EU membership, comes at a price.
There are other ways to cut carbon from the atmosphere.
The second-biggest culprit is methane.
And because methane is a much shorter-lived gas than CO2, we can prevent some of the worst of short-term warming through its mitigation.
A team of economists led by David Montgomery estimates that spending $359 million could realistically slash 19% of black carbon emissions.
First, there is the old law of “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”
In the words of Immanuel Kant, not some Texas governor, no other “penalty is capable of satisfying justice.”
Then there is a utilitarian argument: capital punishment deters many criminals from murder.
TEL AVIV – Finally, the long-sought truce between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has become a reality.
So can it last and evolve into something durable?
Beyond the Gender Gap
Women not only outnumber men at universities; they also outperform them, most notably in math, physics, and information science.
The situation is only slightly better in science. One of every ten professors in Europe is a woman.
But women, too, must adjust.
Big Brother, Tibet, and the Sichuan Earthquake
This question stands out in view of Chinese public opinion in the latter phase of the Tibet crisis.
As a result, those Chinese who use the Internet as a source for news awakened to the fact that no account – Chinese or Western – is flawless.
“Net nannies” – as China’s Internet censors are often dubbed – blocked sensitive articles less frequently.
Nowadays, the government no longer monopolizes information and the right to process it.
A “virtual civil society” is in the making.
That may be the most important lesson of the crisis in Tibet and Sichuan.
Big Brother Google?
The danger lies in the concentration of information – arguably a concentration of power – that Google represents.
Google doesn’t merely point users to existing information on the Web; it also collects information that it doesn’t share about its users’ behavior.
But generally, the free flow of information reduces the concentration of power.
Take, for example, ICANN, the body that sets policy for the Domain Name System.
But it has little coercive power, because anyone is free to try an alternative.
Big Countries, Small Wars
LONDON – US President Barack Obama has vowed to avenge the murder of J. Christopher Stevens, America’s former ambassador to Libya.
In 1864, the Emperor of Abyssinia took hostage the British consul, together with some missionaries, in the country's then-capital, Magdala.
Emperor Tewodros committed suicide, the British withdrew, and their commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Napier, was made Baron Napier of Magdala.
In 1957, the French sent in paratroopers.
Torture was illegal, but, as the Colonel explained, “If you want France to stay, you must accept the consequences.”
Not surprisingly, the US is the leading developer and user of drones, with a fleet of 7,500.
The Americans did this in Vietnam by pouring in consumer goods and building up infrastructure.
The better question is: how can we afford not to?
This possibility is at our fingertips.
We can already see its practical expression.
It is also the reason that global companies like General Electric and Siemens are betting their future on green.
Big Ideas from Small Countries
The American model lost its attractiveness in the 2000’s.
Costa Rica in Central America and Mauritius in Africa each pulled ahead of its regional peers some time ago.
Among many other decisions that have worked out well for them, both countries have foregone a standing army.
A panoply of innovations has helped Chile to outperform its South American neighbors.
Other small advanced countries also have lessons to offer.
Mexico’s innovation was really two revolutions in one.
Nor do I mean to suggest that these examples are entirely responsible for the economic success of the countries where they are found.
Some argue that in the long run there are no tradeoffs.
Even if it were impossible to lower unemployment below some critical level without fuelling inflation, there is uncertainty about what that critical level is.
Workers, for instance, who have much to lose if the central bank pursues an excessively tight policy, do not have a seat at the table.
They need to balance concerns about economic efficiency with those of democratic accountability.
There are no easy answers.
Big Money Merges with Big Brother
But are they?
Yahoo set the pace in pioneering the active collaboration of Internet and high-tech firms with political repression.
In 2005, Yahoo gave the Chinese police the computer identification code for a dissident journalist, Shi Tao.
Shi remains in jail to this day.
After all, the rule of law is what Shi Tao is fighting for.
On Google.cn, these sources, along with the results of searches using many other forbidden terms, simply did not appear.
In the end, Google, not the Chinese Communist Party, lost face.
The tools that they provide are politically neutral.
These tools can be used by Iranians fighting dictatorship, or by Tibetan dissidents trying to save their culture.
LONDON – Ten years after 9/11, the instant history is being written.
In the French newspaper Le Monde, a highly intelligent commemorative supplement dubbed the period “The Decade of Bin Laden.”
Anglo-Saxon-style capitalism crashed.
Moreover, it was the decade when Internet access went global – from 360 million people in 2000 to more than two billion people today.
But it also aggrandized Bin Laden’s claim to be a world historical figure.
The best way to understand the current situation comes from an analogy offered by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
But America today is on the back foot, economically and militarily.
So no one is in charge.
In fact, neither is achievable without political vision.
That is the most important lesson of the post-9/11 decade.
Bin Laden’s Ghost
Bin Laden merely reflected the entrenched violence of the Kingdom’s official ideology.
Biology’s Armaments Race
Biology\u0027s Clash of Civilizations
But this is not the first time that physicists and mathematicians have looked to biology for new fields to plow, and the history of such efforts has been fairly dismal.
As a theoretical physicist, I had been trained to trust only mathematical and logical arguments and to view experimental evidence as fallible.
But the communication gap between experimental and mathematical biologists suggests that the answers depend on specific disciplinary cultures. 
Soon, he set out to build "a systematic mathematical biology, similar in its structure and aims to mathematical physics."
Wilson's colleague, Eric Ponder, was even more pointed, saying that what is required "is more measurement and less theory." 
Turing appears here as a caricature of the mathematical physicist.
Physicists and mathematicians nonetheless have reason to celebrate.
To their credit, many new programs in mathematical biology encourage researchers coming from the mathematical sciences to become practicing biologists themselves.
Meanwhile, "user-friendly" computer programs enable biologists to build their own mathematical/theoretical models. 
Biology is not physics, and to ignore its evolutionary history is to invite irrelevance. 
Biomedicine’s Democratic Revolution
Consider the Beery twins, born in 1996 in San Diego, California.
Then they received a diagnosis of dystonia, a rare neurological disorder.
Their previously diagnosed dystonia was being caused by a genetic mutation that was interfering with the neurotransmitter serotonin.
Rewards in biomedical research go to “solo workers,” and do nothing to acknowledge the work that can be done only by multi-functional groups.
But, at the risk of mixing metaphors, this is a red herring. 
But even this scenario raises no issues of ecological or food safety.
Gene transfer is an age-old concern for farmers.
Canadian farmers and processors accomplish this routinely and without difficulty. 
Gene-spliced plants have for several years been grown worldwide on more than 100 million acres annually.
These prices are not unique to Europe.
China pays $38 per ton of CO2 avoided with wind power, for example, while the US pays around $600 for cutting a ton of CO2 with biofuels.
And the trends since 1900 are sometimes surprising.
In 1900, only 15% of the global workforce was female.
What is the loss from lower female workforce participation?
Human life expectancy barely changed before the late eighteenth century.
This success has many parents.
That much the bear knows well.
But, in reality, most of us are no different from that bear.
All of this applies just to the way the medium works, without taking content into consideration.
Like the bear that learned to fill his stomach comfortably, they feel satisfied to be entertained without having to exert themselves.
Like drinking a glass or two of wine, it helps digestion and lightens the mind.
No bear, if it knew what we do, would fall into that trap.
It could only be a European matter, if the EU were a real federation.
Because he has not thought about the question for one moment.
Blair’s European Dilemma
It includes a Charter of Fundamental Rights.
But it is no revolutionary document.
Eight years on, Europe knows better.
The crisis over the Union’s future direction triggered by a French “No” vote could last for some time.
Most pointedly, is the Islamic world thwarted from modernizing because its culture is trapped in the Middle Ages?
The Islamic world, which stretches over 15,000 kilometers, dozens of countries, and more than 1 billion followers of the faith, is similarly subject to widespread cultural variation.
In some parts of the Islamic world, most notably in the Arabian peninsula, the fertility rate remains very high.
A woman in Yemen will on average give birth to more than 7 children in her lifetime.
Similarly, in Turkey the fertility rate fell from 5.2 in the early 1970s to 2.7 in the late 1990s.
In Indonesia, the decline in fertility rates was about the same.
Islamic culture has neither been a barrier to growth, nor has it been static.
The second tendency is to believe that culture is somehow static and unchanging.
Blatant Benevolence
PRINCETON – Jesus said that we should give alms in private rather than when others are watching.
Rather, we should question whether, in a world in which 25,000 impoverished children die unnecessarily every day, another concert hall is what the world needs.
A substantial body of current psychological research points against Jesus’s advice.
They are a diverse group of people.
Hal Taussig and his wife have given away about $3 million, amounting to 90% of their assets, and now live happily on their social security checks.
Most donors see giving as personally rewarding.
The 50% League sets the bar high – perhaps too high for most people.
It made him rich.
So far, more than 3,500 people have. 
Hong sets the bar low.
We need to get over our reluctance to speak openly about the good we do.
But, in both cases, the lender was distant and anonymous.
The Netherlands and Britain, however followed a different path.
Indeed, the Glorious Revolution enabled a revolution in finance.
Blind in Gaza and Jerusalem
LONDON – I spent the New Year in Sydney, watching the fireworks above the iconic bridge welcome in 2009.
Mahatma Gandhi criticized the biblical justification of retribution, “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”
Blind in Gaza, blind in Jerusalem.
He appears on CNN , but has he actually visited Gaza since his appointment in the summer of 2007?
All more or less agree on this.
Two states.
Some system of joint or international sovereignty over Jerusalem’s holy places and the division of the city so that it can become the capital of two states.
Which of them are strong enough to deal with the West Bank settlers?
Reason has been drowned in blood.
Poor Palestine.
Poor Israel.
Who is there now who can still light a candle in the dark?
Munich's Ifo Institute expects about 2.5--3.3 million migrants to Western Europe during the 15 years following EU enlargement. 
Migrants gain.
If this happens, another ten years may pass before the regulation is modified. 
Indeed, it is virtually impossible nowadays to talk about headscarves as an issue in its own right.
Block thinking fuses a varied reality into one indissoluble unity, and in two ways.
So how can we stop this madness?
Of course, one isn’t likely to meet them in the drawing rooms of Paris journalists or the wider European professional political class.
Hereditary power did not necessarily make for warm and open family relations.
Henry VIII was willing to execute two wives and overturn Christendom in pursuit of a son.
MEXICO – Drug trafficking has existed in Mexico for decades.
Indeed, over 5,000 people were killed by organized drug criminals last year, more than double the death toll in 2007.
Blue Europe, Red Asia
PARIS – Could Europe be a Democratic “blue state” and Asia a Republican “red state”?
As Asia’s leading power, China has seized the mantle of “hope” from the US.
Why favor change, when continuity works so well for you?
They do not want the US only to protect them, but to transform them.
In most places, the name "BMW" implies luxury and exclusivity.
The first scandal occurred last year, after a tractor filled with green onions scraped the side of a BMW in Harbin.
That same month, a lottery scandal threw the BMW brand into the limelight once again.
So instead of mistrusting one person, they grew suspicious of an institution - even of government itself.
Bo’s trial occurred at what is a critical moment for China.
Chinese manufacturing assembly is integral to global supply chains for many products.
Some promising anti-corruption ideas have successful antecedents in Chinese history, from the Ming Dynasty to modern Hong Kong.
Under the Ming Dynasty, the emperor’s officials came from other provinces and were frequently rotated.
And, as in Ming China, judges and other officials could be rotated every few years.
Bolivia Divided
Rural peasants and Indians still support him, as do senior military officials.
Bolivia’s Crisis, Latin America’s Failure
And, of course, it is, with Paraguay, the only land-locked nation on the sub-continent.
Caputo and the UN team then convinced Chilean President Ricardo Lagos to take up the initiative and to promote it with several of his colleagues.
Bolivia\u0027s Populist Temptation
In fact, almost all indicators point to substantial progress made in the 21-year history of Bolivian democracy.
They are part of the modern democracy.
This conflict continues.
As a result, the tax/GDP ratio in most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America has stagnated or even fallen.
Computerizing tax administration, for example, could help to limit corruption by making it more difficult to tamper with records.
With rising public debt worldwide placing fiscal constraints (real and imagined) on global economic recovery, such cooperation is more urgent than ever.
The US Defense Department’s request for $515.4 billion in the 2009 fiscal year dwarfs every other military budget in the world.
The US is allocating more money for defense today than it did during the war against Hitler or the Cold War.
Most other countries don’t come anywhere close.
Iran, depicted by the Bush administration as a major threat, is a military dwarf, spending $6.6 billion on its military.
Indeed, the Pentagon wants to enlarge the Marine Corps and Special Operations forces.
Since it is increasingly difficult to recruit and retain soldiers, to do so will probably require raising their wages and improving their quality of life.
Bombs, Books, and Bucks
The majority of these children are female.
Nearly twice that number will not attend secondary school.
These funds will be needed for schools, teachers, teacher training, materials and equipment, administration, and assessments.
Bombs Away
Several complex things are now happening simultaneously.
But many other parts of the world that still grow.
PARIS – Since the second half of 2012, financial markets have recovered strongly worldwide.
Between September 1 and February 22, the FTSEurofirst index rose by almost 7%.
Beppe Grillo’s populist Five Star Movement emerged with 25% of the popular vote – the highest support for any single party.
The point is that debt-fueled demand emanates from particular households in particular regions for particular goods.
But they differ on solutions.
NEWARK, NJ – Plastics are everywhere.
(All of the embodied energy is lost if the plastics are landfilled, a common disposal method worldwide.)
And, where possible, manufacturers should “down-gauge” materials (make parts thinner).
In a world that is reliant on plastics, more sustainable production, consumption, and disposal of plastic products is crucial.
The green revolution may, of course, prove to be only a temporary respite.
In large corporations, it is often difficult to ascertain the contribution of any individual.
Worse, in America stock options became a preferred form of compensation – often worth more than an executive’s base pay.
Bottom Dollar
Indeed, they fear that the scale of that potential crisis is becoming larger and larger.
In one, the value of the dollar will be low; in the other, the US will be in a depression.
So, what alternative does the market see?
It is no surprise that the ECB is now Ireland’s largest creditor – through buying up its government bonds.
The Emperor’s New Goal
In traditional Japanese culture, India is Tenjiku (the country of heaven).
During the Meiji era, in the second half of the nineteenth century, it became the first Asian country to modernize.
And income inequality in Japan ranks among the lowest in Asia.
American universities benefited mightily from refugee German Jews fleeing Adolf Hitler.
It depends.
Spain, for example, saw its best minds drained away for five centuries, notably following Fascism's victory in the Spanish Civil War.
When Franco died in 1975, Spain's future path was not obvious, as evidenced by the attempted coup of February 1981. 
The problem for a dictator in building universities is that students are needed, and students often protest!
Brave New Financial World
The outcome could impact the world – and not only the esoteric world of international finance – for decades to come.
Finance shapes power, ideas, and influence.
However dubious Bush’s actions may have been on both counts, interest rates on US public debt actually fell.
Is there another paradigm for the global financial system?
The Geithner proposal aims to rein in all of them to some degree.
Where does the balance between risk and creativity lie?
Brave New World Dawning
Children are not biologically equivalent to begin with.
Everyone is born with advantages or disadvantages across a whole range of physical characteristics as well as innate abilities.
Should it be determined by the parents' affluence?
If so, it could mark not only Brazil's economic ascendancy but also the recovery of other parts of South America.
Market projections for Brazil's growth are around 4% for 2004.
I credit FHC, as he is widely known, with making four key contributions.
· Second, Brazil is finally embracing the global knowledge economy.
Under FHC's reforms, enrolment rates in secondary education soared, from 15% in 1990 to 71% in 2000.
FHC appointed a series of outstanding Ministers of Science and Technology, and the government finally began spending more on research and development.
That faith was and is misplaced.
By doing so, the true risks of investing in emerging markets were revealed.
What is the result?
If stability is to be preserved, financial markets need regulators and a lender of last resort.
But there can be no lender of last resort without a modicum of moral hazard.
The system we have in place is lopsided.
The right question to ask is this: what level of interest rates can be reconciled with reasonable growth?
Brazilian bonds would rally and confidence would return at the sight of a lender of last resort.
The crisis would then dissolve into thin air.
This is why financial markets cannot be left to their own devices.
Brazil’s Oil Rush
SÃO PAULO – Brazil is poised to take its place among the world’s petro-powers.
Crédit Suisse and other investment banks say that 50 billion barrels are available.
An additional benefit of dispersing these productive resources will be greater interaction with Brazil’s South American partners.
So Brazil is on a collision course with the future.
Brazil’s Economic Revolution
In the US, despite a slight improvement, uncertainty lingers.
More important, the government’s policies will have a permanent – indeed, revolutionary – impact on Brazil’s economy.
This will become more obvious throughout 2013.
For a long time, Brazil’s interest rates were among the highest in the world.
Bread and Bush-Bashing
The word for bread in Egypt is “aish,” which also means life.
But it is only part of the truth.
Hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty.
Too many.
According to India’s Defense Minister, A.K. Anthony, presumably an expert on butter as well as guns, Bush’s statement was “a cruel joke.”
Now, all this is more than the knock-about of international politics.
One day soon, Bush and Cheney will be out of office.
This conundrum will lie at the heart of the diplomacy next year to find a successor to the Kyoto agreement.
We have already seen many examples of how not to deal with it.
But politics, alas, is politics.
Break to Avoid a Breakup
Anger overflows. Small and medium-sized EU countries feel tricked.
(The Dutch never would go along with this.)
Until France and Germany do change, Europe's game must be a waiting game.
The smaller EU countries also could benefit from a time out.
Belgium, for example, is virtually a satellite of France.
The same is true of Luxembourg.
On the issue of big versus small countries, Europe has a lot to learn from the United States.
But practical challenges remain.
Electric vehicles will need large adjustments to infrastructure.
The Chicago School claims that real-world market economies produce roughly efficient (so-called “Pareto optimal”) outcomes on which public policy cannot improve.
Breaking the Windows Barrier
But it can also stifle development.
For the lay user, technology is encountered mostly as an interactive interface.
The telephone dial didn’t appear until 1919, when the first group of self-designated “user interface scientists” at Western Electric considered what the most intuitive form should be.
When improving a computer interface, form is the key.
Designs are inspired by cognitive science, the arts, even science fiction.
Modern user interface scientists are interested in katachi because it can reveal how form facilitates human interaction.
A traditional example is the tea ceremony, which was developed in Japan in the late sixteenth century.
The format is simple – a host serves tea with some sweets, the guests drink it and then express thanks; that’s all.
Foreigners are often mystified as to why such a minimalist event can require years of training.
An operating system based on katachi’s insights would harness this overlap between shape, sense and environment.
For this reason, let us hope that more developers explore this so-called “disruptive” side of technology during the coming year.
And air quality was also an issue for subsequent Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta, Seoul, and Athens.
In addition, 50,000 old taxis and 10,000 buses have been replaced, and 4,000 of the new buses are powered by natural gas – now the largest fleet of its kind in the world.
Brigitte Bardot and the Wild Dogs of Bucharest
Ionesco’s genius was to portray a world in which the absurd is triumphant.
Imagine the scene: Bucharest, le petit Paris, a city of three million people with wide boulevards and grand bourgeois villas, stands now a city half in ruins.
Unwilling to discriminate between parties, Miss Bardot later kissed our president, Ion Iliescu.
Decades ago, Bucharest held many tiny houses, with courtyards and small gardens.
People kept watchdogs to protect their properties.
The dictator wanted all socialist citizens to live in socialist flats.
Even before the Bardot visit, demonstrators besieged City Hall in opposition to the plan.
Bringing China into the Climate Change Fold
a) The bloody denouement of the protests on Tiananmen Square.
c) The Polish elections.
And so, after six months of bargaining, a historic deal was struck.
Yet that is what happened.
An iconic campaign poster captured the public mood: a picture of a gun-slinging Gary Cooper as the sheriff in the classic western High Noon .
June 4 was the day of reckoning in Dodge City East.
For anti-communists everywhere, the Polish election was extraordinarily encouraging.
There were other signs.
In May, Hungarian reformers began tearing down the fence along their border with Austria – a hole in the Iron Curtain.
None too soon.
EU members are rightfully concerned about human rights in a place dubbed by some “the Cuba of the east.”
But, although Lukashenko is probably playing a divide-and-rule game, he must eventually make a choice.
There is more to come.
A particular version of this phenomenon is at work in the European Union.
Yet when the Icelandic banks failed, the British and Dutch authorities had to bail out local depositors.
So a major effort to construct a cross-border resolution framework is under way.
Britain’s Cultural Kowtow
But is it really true that the world can or should learn about China only by reading works that are sanctioned by the Chinese Communist Party?
China has it, and Britain and other Western countries want it.
A little literary appeasement seems a small price to pay.
China is shipping 10,000 titles to the London Book Fair.
Their literary power derives from their authors’ courage to ask awkward questions and write with honesty.
Instead, we have Magna Carta and cricket.
Before he became Prime Minister, Cameron called for the Human Rights Act to be replaced with something more “British.”
All legislation is passed by a simple majority.
And judges cannot strike down legislation.
The result?
Where, then, does that leave the Cameron government’s supposed extirpation of Big Brother?
Britain’s Retreat from Free Speech
Indeed, Britain essentially invented and gave the rest of the world the idea of free speech.
The City of London, the British Council, Oxfam, and the BBC are now expected to restore the prominence of Britain’s enduring values.
Only the Liberal Democrats are committed to a big cut: scrapping Britain’s nuclear submarines.
In fact, there are two.
The Bank of England’s policy interest rate has remained just above zero for more than two and a half years.
In short, private demand in Britain is flatlining rather than surging.
Broken Promises
On health goals, however, we are not even close. Maternal mortality is falling, but not fast enough.
In doing so it eliminates the need for a program such as Windows, which previously controlled access to every kind of software.
The major advantage of Explorer was not so much a technical one, but rather that Microsoft’s Windows provided the operating software for the overwhelming majority of personal computers.
The ability to have operating systems and software bundled together made life much easier for the average consumer.
You simply got everything you wanted (and probably much more) with the purchase of a computer.
But this also reduced the possibility of choice, of selecting and combining different software.
Computer software was originally not a commodity to be bought, but a service.
It did not sell anything, computers or software.
Leasing software and hardware, as IBM initially did, is problematic.
Bubble Spotting
It is impossible for anyone to predict bubbles accurately.
But some places appear a little more likely than others to give rise to bubbles.
For example, U.S. farmland had a total value of $1.9 trillion in 2010, compared with $16.5 trillion for the US stock market and $16.6 trillion for the US housing market.
But there was no consensus on the longer-run outlook for home prices.
The only precedent for this since 1950 was the 37-month period from September 1974 to September 1977, which launched the worst inflation the US has seen in the last century.
Bubbles without Markets
But the book contained other, non-market, examples as well.
To be sure, events in these economies might seem attributable simply to their leaders’ commands.
Years of dictatorship and sanctions decimated Iraq's business and professional classes.
Consider Venezuela.
It was the same with Saddam Hussein.
Destroying the financial power of the Ancien Regime laid the foundations for the vibrant market democracy France became.
All this will not happen overnight.
Success in this balancing act requires leadership, transparent policies, and good communication.
America provided this in postwar Europe and Japan.
Around 80% of the world’s primary energy today is carbon based: coal, oil, and gas.
That is the right calculation.
Building Greater Europe
Soviet resources, in terms both of infrastructure and ideology, are exhausted.
The EU gives the outward impression of being a successful project.
But this competition is set to occur in a Greater Europe that is becoming marginalized in global terms.
Greater Europe would thus be able to claim a leading role in addressing international issues.
The euro is now six years old.
Here is what emerges:
· The single currency  has boosted international trade within the euro area, by about 10%.
Indeed, the euro has quickly become a symbol of European unity.
To be sure, the introduction of the euro was a true revolution, and we cannot yet see all its effects.
Building on the Global Recovery
What do these contrasts mean for the future?
Other challenges loom.
The problem is imminent in North America, the Euro Area, and Japan.
Poverty also threatens economic stability.
In 2002, at the Monterrey Conference, the international community agreed on a framework for reaching that goal.
Some progress has been made on this "Monterrey Consensus."
The government succumbed and removed the chief minister and his cabinet, placing the troubled province under the care of the provincial governor.
In earlier times, crises of much lesser intensity would have brought the military rushing onto the political stage, as happened in 1958, 1969, 1977, and 1999.
Building Palestine From the Bottom Up
After all the breakdowns in efforts to create a Palestinian state from the top down, only the old-fashioned way – from the bottom up – remains viable.
The same is true of Vietnam’s government and that of the United States.
Now is the time for China, the Philippines, Vietnam, other claimants, and the US to take action to begin to diminish these tensions.
Joint exploration and development of the resources within and beneath the archipelago could then begin.
Built to Bust
BERKELEY – In the mid-2000’s, the United States had a construction boom.
When these buildings were constructed, they were expected to more than pay for themselves.
Both foundations collapsed.
There is another lesson here.
Bulgaria’s Betrayal of Europe
In 2003, his elderly father-in-law was beaten by police agents and forced into internal exile.
Burma was ruled as part of Britain’s Indian Empire until 1935, and the links between the two countries remained strong after Burma gained its independence in 1947.
The Chinese even began developing a port on the Burmese coast, far closer to Calcutta than to Canton.
India’s government cannot be blamed for deciding that its national interests in Burma are more important than standing up for democracy there.
In such conditions, free and fair elections will be impossible.
All the tools at the disposal of the international community should be used to bring this about.
We know that Burma’s political destiny is inextricably linked to that of our own countries.
Burma’s Turn
So far, that transformation, initiated following legislative elections in November 2010, has been breathtaking.
That blueprint has been used throughout Asia in recent decades, most notably in China.
I delivered a lecture in Myanmar in December 2009.
(Relative to its population and income, Myanmar is one of the world’s smallest recipients of international assistance.)
There is much debate about what explains the rapidity of Myanmar’s current pace of change.
ROME: "Get-rich-quick": for thousands of people around the world, that is what investing in the stock market means nowadays.
Certainly, there have been extraordinary periods, such as the 1950s, when the differential between investing in the stock exchange in Milan and treasury securities climbed to over 22%.
Burying Augusto Pinochet
“My commitment will be to travel with you on yet another stretch of this great promenade of freedom we have been opening,” Michelle Bachelet said after being elected in January.
The street euphoria that greeted Bachelet’s victory felt very much like the emotions that gripped Santiago back in 1970, when Allende was elected.
Most importantly, Lagos leaves office having erased from the constitution the dictator’s signature.
In any case, on March 11, when Michelle Bachelet crosses the presidential sash over her chest, a new Chile will set itself in motion.
Bush/Gore: There is a Difference
Start with the first.
New Orleans is a city mostly below sea level, and must be protected by levees to keep water out.
There is a simple fact on display here, one that goes well beyond this particular hurricane, and even this particular president.
Bush bears much responsibility for this.
Hurricanes are measured according to three dimensions: frequency, intensity, and duration.
Duration has risen markedly around the world.
This, too, has risen sharply, and more is in store as temperatures rise.
The first, called “mitigation,” means reducing the amount of manmade climate change.
Another option is to combine carbon-based energy (coal, oil, and gas) with new technologies that prevent the emission of airborne carbon. 
But they also point to the upside: the oil industry, in its never-ending search for more reserves, need not beg Congress for the right to despoil Alaska.
But, again, his administration’s faltering moves will almost surely make matters worse in the immediate future.
Bush still refuses to do anything about conservation, and he has put very little money behind his continuing prayer than technology will save us.
After all, that seems to be the common denominator of every policy controlled by his White House.
Bush’s Dying Days in Gaza
Now it is trying to do the same in Gaza.
The Iranians also sought the meeting to forge an alliance against a possible US attack on their country’s nuclear installations.
Because America’s economy is so large, and the dollar so central to global finance, chronic US budget deficits mean huge global repercussions.
If an insect was introduced into the box, rules governed that, too.
In other words, the torturers had been tortured themselves.
As a result, the goal of a facial slap is not to inflict physical pain, but to induce surprise and humiliation.
To that end, mental damage is preferable to physical injury.
Any video recordings of these sessions, not surprisingly, would be destroyed afterwards.
Bush’s Last Chance
Bush’s New Middle East
Wars, as Winston Churchill defined them, are always “a catalogue of blunders.”
Strategically, the war was an utter failure.
That has also been the result of Bush’s ill-conceived democracy crusade in the Arab world.
Bush’s Old New Plan for Iraq
Now both are gone, and Bush is turning to troop increases.
The goal now is regional stability.
Iraq is not susceptible to a military solution.
But what does it mean to "prevent other great powers from rising"?
But it is not in America's national interest, either.
Such officials staffed the first Bush administration.
Its leadership had no experience in disaster management.
New Orleans is America’s canary in the mineshaft.
We owe this to the dead and to the survivors.
What explains this apparent contradiction?
Iraq comes first.
In essence, this is an argument that the war was justified as a means of promoting human rights.
Under President Bush, that authority has largely evaporated.
Business as Usual with Russia?
The figure for 2009 could exceed $50 billion.
CAMBRIDGE – Spend in haste; repent at leisure.
Just a year ago, the United States had five major freestanding investment banks that stood atop its mighty financial sector.
Does such nitpicking fail to recognize the urgency of fixing the financial system?
Butlers, Bakers, and Capitalists?
The communist revolution that spanned the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was about concentrating government ownership of capital.
In China, the National People’s Congress in 2004 re-defined entrepreneurs and individual proprietors as “builders of the socialist cause,” and included them in the Patriotic United Front.
Revolutions are always experiments, and they are always an adventure.
These monopolies are stronger than ever, and prices, supply, service, and quality all suffer.
These may not be sufficient conditions for success, but they are certainly necessary ones.
California Bad Dreaming
Rumors of an imminent default swirl around Sicily, whose governor has resigned as borrowing soared after cutbacks from Rome.
Compton is rumored to be next; most observers expect more to follow.
The state faces another large budget deficit, yet Governor Jerry Brown’s budget this year includes a substantial spending increase.
Despite these problems, Brown has committed California to a San Francisco-to-Los Angeles high-speed rail boondoggle.
California will most likely be unable to pay for the entire project, leaving little use for the first segment in the sparsely populated Central Valley.
One-party government weakens accountability and breeds hubris.
The unemployment rate, at 10.8%, is almost one-third higher than the national average, and higher than every other state except Nevada and Rhode Island.
One in every four California residents was born in a foreign country.
California is the most diverse US state; more than half of its 37 million people are non-white.
California’s governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, was an immigrant (from Austria) before he was a movie star.
Disengagement from the California polity also is true of the state’s economic engines.
Intel, the world’s biggest chip maker and a Silicon Valley mainstay, hasn’t built a factory in California for more than 20 years.
How to forge a single community out of a state so diverse remains an elusive challenge.
Two of the most influential senators also come from California.
Why these Washington politicians are idle while their state slides towards ruin says much about what’s broken in American politics.
Call In the Reserves
There is a historical parallel to today’s concern about the world’s major reserve currency.
Many were stripped of their responsibilities, and the persons involved were discredited.
But the world has moved since the 1970’s in the direction of greater exchange rate flexibility.
The only question is who will replace him.
In 1960 he was my deputy when I was a leader of the Swedish Liberal Youth organization.
He became Sweden's foreign minister for a year and was later a director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna.
After that war, UN inspectors found and destroyed huge amounts of chemical and biological warheads as well as facilities to produce nuclear weapons.
Saddam's chemical and biological arms, and his determination to get nuclear weapons, are a threat to the world.
The dictator could use these arms himself or make them available to terrorist organizations.
And the issue of war and peace depends on a man repeatedly duped by the Iraqi regime.
Now even European Central Bank Governor Jean Claude Trichet has joined the chorus of concern.
In the face of the dollar’s ongoing fall, policymakers have seemed paralyzed.
As Milton Friedman emphasized, however, the links between monetary policy and inflation are “long and variable.”
Its credits and swaps have never been activated.
The agreement on contributions is significant, it is said, because China and Japan will both contribute 32%.
Also significant, we are told, is the agreement to make decisions by simple majority, with countries’ votes to be roughly in proportion to their contributions.
But there is no agreement on where to situate it or how to staff it.
It could be placed within ASEAN’s Secretariat in Jakarta. It could be placed inside the Asian Development Bank in Manila.
It could be given to the “neutral” Northeast Asian country, Korea.
Can Business Be Ethical?
MELBOURNE – Something new is happening at Harvard Business School.
As of this writing, about 20% of the Harvard graduating class have taken the oath.
Can Central Banks Still Influence Exchange Rates?
This consensus has been maintained through a long period in which exchange rates between the major Western currencies have been allowed to find their own level.
But it did not extend to Asia.
So where does this leave us?
These conditions do not typically apply in Western countries.
The London markets have waited 18 long years already for the Bank of England to appear on their screens, and I suspect their wait will continue for some time yet. 
The water in as many as half of the country’s rivers and lakes is unfit for human consumption or contact.
“China, please slow down.
If you’re too fast, you may leave the souls of your people behind.”  
Given the pervasiveness of Chinese-made goods, China’s safety record concerns consumers worldwide.
The EU is China’s largest trading partner, accounting for $383 billion in merchandise exports in 2010.
But Chinese money has been viewed with suspicion in Europe, reflecting fears that China has a hidden political agenda.
Yet as the example of the Triangle fire suggests, the China's experience is not unprecedented.
There were 30,000 annual work-related fatalities a century ago; today, the annual average is around 5,000, even as the population has tripled.
Further elections are scheduled in Iraq and the Palestinian Authority.
Can Democracy Take Hold in Ukraine?
Indeed, multiple but complementary identities are the norm in all four countries.
But polarization has not been a constant factor in the history of independent Ukraine.
Both ethnic Russians and ethnic Ukrainians view the tenth-century feudal state known as "Kyiv Rus" very favorably.
Can Developing Countries Carry the World Economy?
So the growth potential is correspondingly larger.
Worse still, labor has been displaced from more productive tradable activities (in manufacturing) to less productive informal activities (services).
Emerging-market economies have not yet shown the kind of global leadership that suggests an affirmative answer to this question.
Will it work?
The Italian and Spanish authorities acknowledge as much.
Can Egypt Become a True Democracy?
The first is popular sovereignty, the rule of the people, which is exercised through elections.
This matters, because countries, like individuals, tend to emulate others that they resemble and admire.
Christians, who make up 10% of the population, are the only sizable minority.
MILAN – Over the past two years, industrial countries have experienced bouts of severe financial instability.
Currently, they are wrestling with widening sovereign-debt problems and high unemployment.
So it is important to know whether this breakout growth phase is sustainable.
These risks are real.
Left to their own devices, they are up to the task.
But they do not operate in a vacuum.
A problem that began in Greece ended up raising doubts about the very viability of the euro – and even of the European Union itself.
Europe’s leaders have never fully deployed their economic and political firepower.
Europe is on the brink of recession.
The G-20’s efforts will culminate in the Cannes Summit in November.
But adverse movements in the terms of trade must be accommodated; they cannot be fought with monetary policy.
But these have seldom worked.
But this depends on how stockpiles are administered.
In rich countries, where the primary producing sector usually has political power, stockpiles of food products are used as a means of keeping prices high rather than low.
As a result, production fell.
(Shortages and long lines can fuel political rage just as surely as higher prices can.)
By now this should be clear to everybody.
But one cannot really expect the G-20 agriculture ministers to be able to fix the problem.
Prices are not determined solely by the flow of current supply and demand and their current economic fundamentals (such as disruptions from weather or politics).
Shooting the messenger is no way to respond to the message.
But is Eastern Europe an exception?
But in countries like South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, multinational companies may look very different.
Consider diamond mining, Namibia’s biggest industry and export.
Yet every year, new brick houses, some quite substantial, emerge among the hovels.
Her stall is far from ideal; with every gust of wind, sand and dirt blow over the meat.
Indeed, there is volatility just beneath the surface.
But the problem is not only the numbers; it is one of credibility.
But you cannot outrun a lion, says the other man, to which the first replies: “I don’t have to outrun the lion. I just have to outrun you.”
But nothing of the sort appears in the truncated text approved by Hamas.
And, in politics, as Machiavelli pointed out long ago, it is more important to be feared than loved.
Shifts to more energy-efficient means of transportation ease congestion.
The Republican Party and the American Petroleum Institute sank that proposal.
For many years after independence in 1947, India remained a large and poor country.
India's population is now much larger, and it is still poor--but not as poor as it might have been.
It is a fear that prevails not only in India, but in China, South Africa, Mexico, and Brazil.
But states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh could well remain stagnant, falling ever deeper into relative deprivation.
India's central government retains an important role to play in reaching out to the poor.
Now India must deliver.
But democracy cannot be delivered to Iraq by an outside power.
So what is keeping Berlusconi and his coalition in the race?
The Berlusconi coalition also benefits from the weakness of l’Unione.
Under this system, Casa della Libertà translated a small popular majority in 2001 into a decisive parliamentary majority.
The puzzle of Berlusconi’s survival reflects a wider European conundrum.
Can Radiation Be Good For You?
What are we to make of all this?
One thing is certain: at all but extremely low doses – perhaps only slightly higher than background levels – radiation causes cancer.
If you want to comprehend all the nuances, get a science degree from M.I.T. or the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule in Zurich.
The Soviet Union had the world’s largest territory, the third largest population, and the second largest economy, and it produced more oil and gas than Saudi Arabia.
In 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev described the Soviet economy as “very disordered.
Yet in 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed.
Whereas ethnic Russians comprised only 50% of the Soviet Union’s population, they now make up 81% of the Russian Federation.
Instead, up to now at least, the government has mostly been providing (high-interest) loans rather than engaging in massive equity buyouts.
In previous times, such a situation would have been described as pre-revolutionary.
Those strengths lie in Europe’s science base, part of the cultural heritage that shapes European identity.
In fact, that question is wedded to an obsolete linear model of innovation.
They obtained new knowledge of how to manipulate and intervene in natural processes.
This was the case in 1700, and it remains true today.
Let us now look forward towards the future.
Six billion will live in Asia, one billion in Africa, 1.5 billion in the Americas, and 500 million in Europe.
Moreover, the greatest threat of the 1960’s and 1970’s – nuclear annihilation – has diminished.
Soon after World War II, physicists at the University of Chicago started a journal called the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists to promote arms control.
The logo on the Bulletin’s cover is a clock, the proximity of whose hands to midnight indicates the editors’ judgment of the precariousness of the world situation.
It came closest to midnight in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
But the clock has been creeping forward again.
We are confronted by proliferation of nuclear weapons (by, say, North Korea and Iran).
Al-Qaeda-style terrorists might willingly detonate a nuclear weapon in a city center, killing tens of thousands.
The global village will have its village idiots.
Can Terrorism Be Cured?
Terrorism is likely to define the year 2006 as much as it has ever year since 2001.
Years from now, historians will likely label the opening years of the twenty-first century the “Age of Terrorism.”
Bush, in contrast, believes that terrorism is rooted in the absence of political and economic opportunity.
In some societies, democracy is simply a way for the majority to repress the minority.
Worse still, a cure may not exist.
TRIVANDRUM, INDIA – It is fashionable these days, particularly in the West, to speak of India and China in the same breath.
Some even speak of “Chindia,” as if the two were joined at the hip in the international imagination.
If China wants to build a new six-lane expressway, it can bulldoze its way through any village in its path.
But if we can’t compete, can we co-operate?
The two civilizations had centuries of contact in ancient times.
And yet, there is some good news.
The key operating components of Apple’s iPod were invented by the Hyderabad company PortalPlayer, while the iPod itself are manufactured in China.
The only question is whether political tensions could bring the music screeching to a halt.
What could replace them?
The Nobel laureate Robert Mundell laid out the conditions under which a single currency could work.
Europe didn’t meet those conditions at the time; it still doesn’t.
The question was, what conditions would be imposed on Greece?
How big would be the adverse impact?
The contrast between conditions in Germany and Spain illustrates the problem.
If Spain and Germany still had the peseta and the D-mark as their respective currencies, the differences in trade balances would cause the mark to appreciate and the peseta to decline.
But remaining in the euro zone could impose significant costs on some of them.
Can the G-8 Survive St. Petersburg?
Can the IMF Avert a Global Meltdown?
This year, the US will borrow roughly $800 billion to finance its trade deficit.
The time has come to reinforce Goal 8 in two fundamental ways.
In some countries, doctors find it more remunerative to work as translators for foreign-aid agencies than to treat poor patients.
Trade is the other key area.
The European Union’s agricultural subsidies, for example, are high enough to permit every cow in Europe to fly business class around the world.
What African farmer, despite his lower initial costs, can compete?
But Goal 8 assured them that they would not be alone in this effort.
The European Commission recently proposed important changes to how the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is to be implemented.

During World War II, Allied soldiers occupied Iran, using the country as a way station to transport supplies from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet Union.
So much has changed since then.
On the contrary, we long for interaction with the West.
Problems arise when we try to agree on a definition of happiness, and to measure it.
John Maynard Keynes famously said: “I would rather be vaguely right than precisely wrong.”
Can we learn how to measure happiness?
Trying to reduce them to a single number will require some difficult value judgments.
Without the Commission’s approval, it cannot go ahead.
Insurance companies have not penetrated many of the regions that suffered the greatest losses.
You wouldn’t want to rely on it.
If not made mandatory, insurance must at least be promoted effectively.
Many of the worst outcomes in Asia occurred in tsunami-prone areas, such as the low-lying coastal areas of Sri Lanka.
Can We Regulate Systemic Risk?
Periodic outbreaks of instability impose high social costs on those who had the least to do with causing them.
Let’s call them RWT (reject when true) and AWF (accept when false).
Instability just strikes like lightning.
This seems wrong.
At this stage, however, we are still largely treading on  terra incognita .
A related concern is measurement.
Either the “detected” pathology is not there, or it is not the sort that will kill you.
Consider the following hypothetical example.
On average, 500 people will have the cancer.
Cancer World
PITTSBURGH – In 1971, President Richard M. Nixon launched a “war” against cancer.
By age 50, their chromosomal bands are profoundly different from one another.
Cannabis and the Brain
As a neuro-scientist, I am concerned about this debate. 
The results from clinical trials are awaited.
If cannabis is a pain-killer, then it must have a huge impact on the physical brain. 
Cannabis affects a variety of chemical systems and it works via its own `receptor,' it's own molecular target.
No surprise, then, that because these long-term effects seem to be irreversible, there is an effect on brain pathology.
A counter-argument to such thinking is to challenge whoever thinks that there is a `safe' dose of cannabis, with no effect on the brain, to say what that dose might be.
The answer lies in Ayn Rand’s rhetorical invocation of despair in her 1957 epic Atlas Shrugged: “Who is John Galt?”
Interest rates thus incentivize and convey to entrepreneurs how to allocate capital through time.
But, as Rand reminds us, at some point the jig is up.
Perhaps the best explanation has to do with attitudes, not ideology.
But that book’s potency originally derived from its fierce independence from contemporary orthodoxies.
The book for the new epoch has yet to be written, but I have a proposed title: Capitalism and Skepticism .
Europe's Enron-induced schadenfreude is kaput.
Clean capitalism needs the same sort of widespread engagement.
Consider the trip to the mall, where shoppers buy goods produced and shipped from around the world.
The personal aspect of such decisions makes our hearts speed up and our palms sweat.
We simply have a sense that sharing with someone who has trusted us is the right thing to do.
We have also found that about 2% of undergraduates we studied are pure non-cooperators.
The technical term in my lab for these people is “bastards.”
Their character traits are similar to those of sociopaths.
These external penalties can displace the internal sanctions we feel when we do wrong.
Think of Charlie Chaplin’s film  Modern Times , in which the little tramp is literally a cog in the capitalist machine.
That view, a residue of Marxist thinking, is wrong.
Blair called for a new financial order based on “values other than the maximum short-term profit.”
“We need to return to a smaller scale, one that touches people.
Capitalism versus Democracy
The connection between capitalism and democracy is far from automatic.
Traditionally, protecting the common interest was the task of the nation state.
In today's world, most conflicts occur not between states but within states.
That is what my network of foundations seeks to do.
Economics and politics cannot be separated.
But that does not mean we should abandon the idea.
The goal is to eliminate the moral hazard introduced by the IMF.
So far, civil society has been mobilized for the destruction of international institutions as in the recent protests against the WTO and World Bank in Seattle and Washington.
We must reverse the trend and start a movement for the creation of a global open society.
Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics
Marx and Mao are probably spinning in their graves.
Who are these businessmen President Jiang wants to court and how do they operate?
Officially, China remains Communist.
In fact, more students than ever who left for universities in Japan, the US, and Europe are being lured back.
Consider the story of Shenyang-based Neusoft Group, China's largest publicly traded software company, with sales of $134 million last year.
Neusoft began as a low-cost competitor to the Oracle Corporation.
Similar manufacturing clusters are sprouting up everywhere in China.
Japanese companies also prefer Qingdao, on the Shandong Peninsula, which specializes in production of high-quality processed food.
Consider Japan's Fast Retailing Company, which retails high-quality clothing manufactured in China under the Uniqlo brand in its own Japanese outlets.
The US confronted something similar in the late 1980s.
This “liberated” a lot of liquidity for financial activities, gambling, and speculation.
Capitals of Capital
NEW YORK – Recently, China’s government announced that it wants Shanghai to become a global financial capital equal to London and New York by 2020.
In China, exports fell by more than 25% in February.
First, it’s tough enough for leaders within the Chinese Communist Party elite to agree on economic-policy priorities.
Factions within the Russian, Indian, Mexican, and South African governments have their own competing political priorities.
Captured Europe
How did this happen?
But that is only part of the problem.
Did all hell break loose?
But that is not because banks prepared themselves by raising more capital.
I wake her up in the morning, assist her in toileting, bathing, and dressing, make us breakfast, and help her feed herself.
I assist her in walking, placing her in a chair, and getting into our car.
The result is moral impoverishment of the practice of medicine.
To prepare for a career of care-giving, medical students and young doctors clearly require something besides scientific and technological training.
In essence, the practitioner must come to feel that the art of care-giving is as much at stake as the science and technology of diagnosis and treatment.
In my view, what is needed is reform of the very culture of contemporary biomedicine.
Caring about Animals in the Era of Foot and Mouth
The symbol of new life would become dead meat.
Then the farmer would have happily banked the cheque he was paid for doing this.
Oh please!
Where have the people been all these years?
Cars, Bombs, and Climate Change
“How can that possibly be true?” they ask.
All we have to do is lower the speed limit everywhere to five kilometers per hour.
The biofuel lesson is salutary.
Cash Aid for Africa
While Africa’s needs are relatively well known, there are challenges in scaling up aid to tackle them.
While it assumes predictable financial flows, such predictability can be spurious.
A formula for burden sharing would be needed that gradually increases domestic financing.
It has now reached the agenda of some African governments and the African Union.
Yet the results are anemic.
The case of Mozambican cashews clearly illustrates this.
In the 1960s, Mozambique produced half of the world's total.
Mozambique became the first African country to process cashews on a large scale.
By 1980, the country had 14 processing factories.
Second, reform is a "political" problem as well as being a "technical" one.
Celebrating the German Model
What are those values?
Celebrating the Irrational
Censor and Sensibility
Peer-to-peer technologies make filtering more difficult, because they put nearly any consumer of information into the process of transmitting it.
It makes good political sense; it could make good business sense as well.
Central Asia’s Other Turkmenbashis
A dictator’s sudden death almost always triggers political instability.
Most of them are old, some of them are unwell.
The Caspian region accounts for 2% to 3% of the world’s known oil resources – about equal to that of North Sea oil.
And, like China and Russia, Iran has no desire to see the US fill any security vacuum that could emerge as a result of leadership changes in Central Asia.
As long as the US remains involved militarily in Afghanistan, access to facilities in Central Asia will remain important.
However, the political situation in Kyrgyzstan is far from stable.
Today, there are many more players involved, and the stakes – energy security, above all – are far higher now.
Central Asia’s Waking Giant
Yet few outside Central Asia have heard much about it.
The SCO emerged from the wreckage of the Soviet Union in 1996.
Today, its members are Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, while Mongolia, Iran, Pakistan and India are observers.
CHICAGO – Poor Ben Bernanke!
He has adopted innovative new methods of monetary easing.
Yet progressive economists chastise him for not doing enough.
Their logic is simple.
Even if we can coerce traditional debt-free savers to spend, it is unlikely that there are enough of them in Las Vegas.
Central Europe\u0027s Fractious Right
Political developments in Czechoslovakia during the last 20 years of communism set the Czech Republic and Slovakia apart from both Poland and Hungary.
No strong social democratic party in Czechoslovakia could emerge from the rigid Czechoslovak Communist Party.
Christian-democratic parties, associated with the Catholic Church, and the liberals have been to some extent marginalized.
Central Europe’s Misguided War on Drugs
Many are now members of the European Union.
For example, Gdansk – the birthplace of the Solidarity movement – does not have a single methadone treatment center.
And they are the lucky ones.
In a step forward, a debate in the Polish parliament on the proposed drug law is set to start in September.
Central Europe’s Unsentimental Education
BUDAPEST – This month marks the 20th anniversary of the reburial of Imre Nagy, the leader of Hungary’s failed anti-Soviet revolution of 1956.
History also played a part in the success of the Hungarian transition.
The 1956 revolution was a real one, with barricades.
A new generation was also needed.
The past 20 years can be divided into three phases.
But, for Central Europe as a whole, the past 20 years have been the best since the Peace of Westphalia, with Slovakia and Slovenia even joining the euro zone.
Money was stolen, not merely “mismanaged.”
Central Europe has found itself in a completely new situation.
But is Río any better?
Indeed, inflation was 13% in 2001.
Stores are full of goods.
Caracas is no Havana.
What, then, is the truth about Venezuela?
The Rowhani Front
None of these statements is new.
Rowhani used this against him very effectively.
BEIJING – In the last 100,000 years or so, our planet has endured an Ice Age and a few mini-ice ages.
In the words of David Victor, of the University of California, San Diego, the coming Heat Age will be “nasty, brutish, and hot.”
We can already get a sense of the far-reaching consequences of climate change.
So what can be done to find big solutions?
At the World Economic Forum’s recent Summit on the Global Agenda in Abu Dhabi, I made three suggestions to tackle climate change.
Given that China currently is the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, it clearly has an outsize role to play.
Relatively few economies (five to be precise, all in Asia: Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore) successfully managed this transition while sustaining high growth rates.
So a great deal is at stake, both internally and externally.
There are at least five important interconnected transitions embedded in China’s new Five-Year Plan:
A huge number of new businesses need to be created.
Labor-intensive industries in the tradable sector must be allowed to decline.
But there are now issues.&nbsp; Investments are justified and support economic and social development when they have high private and social returns.
Elements of the investment portfolio in the public sector and the SOEs are beginning to fail this test.
Climate change is equated with “global warming,” but much more than warming is involved.
The first is energy conservation through more fuel-efficient vehicles.
New hybrid automobiles, pioneered by Toyota, use both gasoline and electric power to boost gasoline efficiency by approximately two-fold.
All major regions of the world will need to be involved.
Kennedy’s successor, Lyndon Johnson, lamented that he lacked charisma.
In practice, charisma is a vague synonym for “personal magnetism.”
Charity in Hard Times
That’s a higher annual death toll than during World War II, and it’s easier to prevent.
Poverty will lead to more migrants seeking to move, whether legally or not, to rich nations.
The cease-fire thus covers a huge area: the 778-kilometer LoC, the 150-kilometer AGPL and the 198-kilometer international border.
Checks and Balances in an EU Constitution
Unfortunately, this instrument is unavailable at the EU level, or at least it is seriously deficient. 
We are thus left with a fundamental dilemma.
Europe would need to have political institutions more typical of a federation than of a confederation of states.
This picture is both badly distorted – and harmful to the victims of the Chernobyl accident.
About that there is no doubt.
Fear of radiation, it seems, poses a far more potent health threat than does radiation itself.
Childhood Lost
The cries of working children can be heard the world over.
Children in Central America harvest crops sprayed with pesticides.
Indian children inhale large doses of sulphur and potassium chlorate to fashion flammable powder into matches.
If they live that long.
Thousands of children don't.
Pakistani parents occasionally maim their children to make them beguiling beggars.
Since laws are not the answer to child labor, many experts propose compulsory education as a means to curb it.
Working children are entitled to something better, regardless of whether they know it.
Children of Frenchmen
Museums, gardening, clubs of all sorts are blossoming in today’s France.
Private associations, it seems, have picked up where political parties and trade unions have left off.
Chile and the Third Wall
SANTIAGO – Chile celebrated 200 years of independence in 2010.
Secondly, these goals are attainable because the world has changed.
Yet not even this will suffice if we are to build on rock and not on sand.
Chile\u0027s New President, General Pinochet and the Po
SANTIAGO: After a hard-fought electoral battle, Chile has a new president.
His characteristically intellectual rhetoric was replaced by simple and direct appeals to the electorate.
This would not only remove Pinochet from Chile's political life, but would also permit the courts to greatly expedite the trial against him.
Marco himself was elected deputy on the Socialist ticket, but he defected when the party denied him the chance to contest Frei’s nomination in a primary.
In recent years, several groups have split from the incumbent parties.
China, Inc. Goes Global
Any part of these production chains can be located wherever it suits the firms’ international competitiveness best.
In Asia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan were (and have been) among the beneficiaries.
Beside it is the stunning “water cube,” or Aquatics Center, of Chinese/Australian design.
In a matter of days, an emissary was dispatched and al-Bashir relented.
Beneath the surface are many threatening cracks.
That situation is changing.
But, because it did not, it has shown up as inflation instead.
Moreover labor shortages began to appear, and Chinese workers began to win rapid wage increases.
Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai raised their minimum wages sharply in the last three years – by 22% on average in 2010 and 2011.
The laws of international economics still apply.
In terms of economic output, today’s EU is on par with the US.
Moreover, unlike the Chinese, they have not always been confident of their position in the world.
It has been used repeatedly: by Japan beginning in the last decades of the nineteenth century; by the Asian Tigers in the second half of the twentieth century; and now by China.
Here is the moment of strategic uncertainty.
Over a long generation, England was transformed.
No doubt China’s own path will be as distinctive as the processes by which it has reached its current moment of opportunity.
They insist that China will go ahead with plans to introduce margin trading, short selling, and futures contracts on share prices.
Building a Chinese Rechtsstaat
And the state must comply with its obligations in international law.
Outside observers often forget that reform in China involves changing the oldest, largest, and most complex bureaucracy in the world.
Otherwise, China would quickly reach its “limits to growth,” with disastrous ecological and, as a result, political consequences.
Strategically, however, China and the US will have to rely on one another for a long time.
When there is no big bubble, there is no need to worry about a big crisis.
China on the Move
Urban workers’ per capita income is more than three times higher than that of their counterparts in the countryside.
As a result, migrant workers – an underclass numbering roughly 160 million – remain shut out of government-supported health care, education, and social security.
Vision and strategy are vital for realizing the “China Dream,” as the country’s new leaders are now calling it.
China Going Forward
Economic growth, of course, has never been linear in any country.
China has become one of the most polluted countries in the world.
Dust and smog choke its cities.
All of the country’s major rivers are contaminated.
For example, in volume terms, China now is the largest car producer in the world, churning out 17 million this year.
And when a giant falls, many are hurt.
China’s strong fiscal position today gives it a window of opportunity.
Under China’s current institutional arrangements, meritocracy is a prerequisite for good governance.
Fortunately, because of globalization, China’s rise is in everyone’s interest, as is the rise of other emerging economies.
China in Action on Climate Change
China attaches great importance to tackling climate change.
In 2007, it established the National Leading Group on Climate Change (NLGCC), headed by Premier Wen Jiabao.
The rest of an unbalanced Chinese economy followed – especially the labor market, which shed more than 20 million jobs in Guangdong Province alone.
The “ghost city” critique misses this point entirely.
There is also ample scope for monetary easing; unlike central banks in the West, the People’s Bank of China has plenty of ammunition in reserve.
In 1895, China was defeated by Japan, a tiny aggressor whom the Chinese dismissively called wa (the dwarf).
Japan thus became the focus of Chinese attention.
China Must Do More than Mediate
SINGAPORE – Behind a veil of secrecy, China’s development of strategic and tactical missiles is well into its third generation of modernization.
These include the DF-31 and DF-31A, which are equipped with nuclear payloads.
Only in the last half-millennium was it overtaken by Europe and America.
By 1940, this fell to one-fifth, even though Asia was home to three-fifths of the world’s population.
Even so, they would not be equal in composition or sophistication.
The baby was dying of AIDS.
In May 2003, MSF was authorized to set up an HIV/AIDS clinic in Xiangfan, Hubei Province.
Treatment is extremely limited where it is available.
For example, Xiangfan’s Infectious Diseases Hospital is the prefecture’s only health facility where HIV/AIDS patients can be admitted.
Kowtow or Cooperation in Asia?
Not so fast, said Filipino President Benigno S. Aquino III. No such agreement had been made.
Hun Sen had mischaracterized the discussions among ASEAN’s leaders.
From India to Japan, every Asian country must play its part.
International orders emerge either by consensus or through force.
For now, however, China has other ideas.
China cannot meet this standard, either.
What is to be done?
Many of those arrested and prosecuted hail from Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the northwest of the country that is home to a large and restive Muslim population.
China is more than 90% Han.
Sentences for non-Han Chinese are typically longer than those imposed on Han Chinese.
That happened to Yue Zhengzhong, who sent an intercepted letter to the US Embassy praising the 1999 bombing of China's Embassy in Belgrade.
He had written that those killed deserved their fate.
Li Wenshan and Chen Shiqing, leaders of the Chinese Nation's Democratic Party, which has nearly 1,000 members, are serving long sentences in Gansu Province's Linxia Prison.
Scholars, too, feel the heat.
Prisons are closed to outside visitors.
Indeed, the start of 2005 saw some movement on improved ties, with the introduction of a hugely successful lunar new year charter-flights program.
As DPP legislator Hsiao Bi-khim recently said, the anti-secession law “will make it very hard for us to be moderates”.
There is thus little reason to believe that a more explicitly assertive stance is necessary for dealing with the “splittist” government in Taipei.
By any standards, the reform agenda is ambitious – especially given a fragile and unaccommodating external environment.
The result?
To be sure, the US remains Asia's power broker, as it has been since the end of WWII.
His interest is understandable.
In November, the first ever India-China joint naval exercises were held off the Chinese coast.
Should we ever expect to see wild gyrations in China’s exchange rate of the sort one routinely sees in, say, the Australian dollar or the South African rand?
But there may well be a lot more to come over the next 12-18 months.
China’s first currency move was brilliant only if it is not the last.
Their participation in the solution of global problems will be essential.
Nonetheless, growing US-Chinese cooperation within the G20 last year was a positive sign of bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation.
Again, China sent a low-ranking official.
China is rife with overinvestment in physical capital, infrastructure, and property.
The government has established a new agency, Central Hujin Investment Company, to manage and re-capitalize big state-owned banks before they are sold.
Hujin has already injected $60 billion of China’s foreign-exchange reserves into the Bank of China, the China Construction Bank, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank.
The Bank of Communications’ performance suggests that China’s lending boom of 2003 and 2004 could lead to another wave of defaults this year and next.
They will make loans on the basis of commercial criteria rather than relations with big state-owned companies.
China’s Best Hope
Widespread economic distress is never without political consequences.
Few people, even Party members, still believe in Marxism-Leninism, let alone Maoism.
But there is an alternative.
But this has not been the case.
Someday, of course, this will come to an end.
Enter the Blackstone Group.
Blackstone will gain extra cash to deploy and extra fees.
This March, I was in Chengdu, in Sichuan province, where many Tibetans live.
The colorful Tibetan district was cordoned off.
Some probably are.
This argument has a long history.
Taiwan, under Japanese rule, was in fact more modern than other parts of China.
Not necessarily.
In this respect, the Tibetans are no worse off than other citizens of the People’s Republic of China.
Historic monuments are being bulldozed everywhere in China in the name of development.
The problem, then, is not mainly one of nationality or discrimination, but of politics.
This is true not only for Tibet, but also for the rest of China.
Tibetans will be free only when all Chinese are free.
In that sense, if in no other, all citizens of China hang together.
Relations between China and Latin America and the Caribbean are paradoxical.
There are two aspects to this paradox.
To a lesser degree, Latin American enterprises – such as Gruma, Modelo, Embraer, Marco Polo, and Embraco – have successfully introduced themselves in China.
Even in the Caribbean and Central American countries – several of which do not have diplomatic relations with China – commerce has been prolific.
So dividing Latin American countries into “winners” and “losers” makes no sense.
Food often remains unavailable in rural areas.
So what is Kim up to with this latest attack on South Korea?
Its Internet community is expanding at hyper speed, with profound implications for the Chinese economy, to say nothing of the country’s social norms and political system.
This genie cannot be stuffed back in the bottle.
Once connected, there is no turning back.
The pace of transformation is breathtaking.
In China, this share is just 55%.
Its rapidly expanding Internet community has repeatedly raised national awareness of tough local issues.
China’s “SkyNet” team (rumored to be greater than 30,000) is the largest cyber police force in the world.
Should, or can, China achieve long-term growth only by adding physical structures?
He replied, “The Brazilian economy has been doing well.
“Well,” I said, “Brazil is a democracy.
The wonderful Olympics sites in Beijing were no accident, but rather a result of the system.
State-owned land is valued at more than $7 trillion.
This can be done by putting these assets into national wealth funds and distributing the funds’ shares to citizens at no cost.
Building a nation demands more than steel and concrete.
China’s Consumer Communism
China has changed dramatically since the mid-1980’s.
It’s not just the increase in the number of freeways, billboards, and skyscrapers that disorient long-time visitors.
Now, Time magazine calls the city the “most happening” place on earth.
Of course, Newspeak is alive and well in many places, and there are certainly Orwellian echoes in the authorities’ pronouncements and actions.
China’s Cyber-Warriors
The first is national, with the hackers largely interested in two objectives.
The other objective is commercial: to pilfer intellectual property.
Ever since their reinvention by Pierre de Coubertin, the Olympic Games have always been politicized.
The Seoul Games in 1988 opened the door to South Korea’s democratization.
Hu and Chen clearly respect the law.
But the Party is haunted by the Soviet precedent.
The Olympic Games are being designed to promote this alternative model.
How legitimate is this model?
With fewer children to replenish the workforce, the working-age cohort of those 15-64 years old would shrink from 68.4% to 60.7%.
In 2004, for example, Guangdong Province had to raise the mandatory minimum wage by as much as 20% to attract workers from other regions.
And Wen has indicated that village elections might be extended to the next highest government level – township administrations – over the next few years.
Professor Yu and others have been nudging democracy forward within the Communist Party itself.
Confucian-inspired intellectuals like Jiang Qing, for example, have put forward an innovative proposal for a tricameral legislature.
This constituted a breakthrough in party tactics.
So how important will this 16th Party Congress be?
It already has more than $2 trillion.
But will Americans’ newfound moderation last?
China does not want to be left holding a $4 trillion bag when it happens.
It is up to China to take the lead on the post-Pittsburgh agenda.
How, then, should today’s Chinese economy be characterized?
Both labels mislead.
HONG KONG – In a recent article, the economist Axel Leijonhufvud defines the market system as a web of contracts.
These contracts are the most ancient and remain the foundation of social relationships in China today.
Corporate contracts place the profit-oriented legal person at the center of the transaction and bind all of its stakeholders.
Non-governmental and non-profit civil contracts bind people together for communal, religious, social, and political activities.
Examining webs of contracts should be similar to a biologist’s examination of cell structure and DNA.
The current project pipeline also implies less than 50% utilization for wind-power equipment manufacturers in 2010.
One site was still operating 24 hours a day; in others production had been temporarily halted until the deadline passed.
In only a very few cases had any machinery actually been removed.
A financial center was simply a great metropolis where enormous financial dealings took place.
Or is such a goal necessary because a financial center can determine the fate of a great metropolis?
Cities do not become financial centers because they are more “excellent” than other cities, or because they have done something that other cities failed to do.
If it does, the impact on the global capital market would be enormous.
University students in the regions of the proposed dams have also become engaged through Internet chat groups.
Europe has plenty of those.
This is only a start.
Of course not!
China has invested billions of dollars in African oil production, mining, transportation, electricity production and transmission, telecommunications, and other infrastructure.
Yet closer relations have brought controversy.
African countries have become large buyers of Chinese weapons and military equipment.
In so unstable a continent, one saturated with weaponry, pouring in more guns is hardly welcome.
The ongoing Darfur conflict illustrates the problem.
Africa’s economy may grow, but Africans will continue to suffer.
China\u0027s Great Internet Firewall
How can this be?
They must support, or at least not question, the Chinese Communist Party's monopoly on political power; and
As long as the middle class supports state repression, order can be upheld.
If they become unhappy, they can always console themselves with a pirated DVD.
BEIJING – China’s Henan province has a population of about 100 million – larger than that of most countries.
In China’s administrative system, a province is at the highest level of sub-national government, followed by counties, cities, and townships.
But a township in Guangdong province can easily serve a population of 500,000 to one million – larger than that of many cities outside of China.
Lanzhou, the capital city of Gansu province in the west, might never catch up with Suzhou, a well-known manufacturing base near Shanghai.
Without a road, you cannot transport resources and finished goods.
The same could be said of the global North-South disparity.
But these have occurred in every country at China’s current stage of development, and China, too must go through it.
China’s Green Debt
Consider “Green GDP.”
For now, there is simply no alternative.
Local communities, non-governmental organizations, and businesses all must do their part.
They cannot limit themselves simply to “supervision” and appeals to the authorities.
China is dangerously near a crisis point.
Indeed, the situation is much like that of the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
Indeed, recognizing its over-investment in infrastructure, the government recently abandoned several high-speed rail projects that were already under construction.
But government over-investment is also evident in numerous industrial parks and high-tech zones.
But the downside is equally pronounced.
One negative consequence is the persistent deepening of income inequality.
As a result, a majority of rural kids will enter the workforce without a university diploma.
Yet China is in no mood to plead poverty when dealing with the West.
Gansu’s challenges range from modernizing its heavy industries to resisting desertification and the encroachment of the Gobi desert.
The answer is not for China to step up its public-relations effort.
But when the dust settles, the new data may be less revolutionary than some people believe.
But size is not all that matters.
The new PPP data also have implications for evaluating the extent of poverty and the level of a currency’s exchange rate.
For example, the data for China are based on surveys in just 11 cities.
In any case, earlier calculations depended on an even greater amount of guesswork.
As for the exchange rate, PPP is only one of many ways to calculate its equilibrium level.
China’s Industrial Nightmare
Now, attention has now turned to food.
China’s Internet Dictatorship
Today, China is the only country in the world that has enshrined in law the concept of a “Web political criminal.”
Now these people find themselves exposed to the Public Security Bureaus.
But not forever.
China’s Landing – Soft not Hard
NEW HAVEN – China’s economy is slowing.
To be sure, the economic data have softened.
But this is not 2008.
And more than 20 million migrant workers reportedly lost their jobs in export-led Guangdong province.
By late 2008, China was in the throes of the functional equivalent of a full-blown recession.
Thanks to a massive fiscal stimulus, China veered away from the abyss in early 2009.
Like Shanghai Pudong in the late 1990’s, today’s Chinese “ghost cities” are likely to be teaming urban centers in the not-so-distant future.
At 6.5%, the one-year lending rate is now 0.3% above August’s headline inflation rate.
As a result, there are now major questions about the sustenance of China's long powerful export-led growth model.
The newspaper noted that Wolfowitz sounded like a character out of the mafia television show The Sopranos .
In 1998, Guangdong province alone received 26.5% of FDI while the entire West of China received 3%.
As a result, those living in Shanghai enjoy a real income twice that of the Northwest and 60% higher than the Southwest.
For example, the real unemployment rate in the Northeast is already over 10% and this region will feel the strongest impact from agricultural changes.
It is no surprise, then, that rural and urban unrest is mounting.
China’s rulers rarely wash their dirty linen in public.
On the contrary, as Ye has candidly acknowledged, the number of corruption cases “has continued to rise.”
In 2005, the World Bank ranked China 142nd out of 204 countries on the “Control of Corruption” index.
Since most government corruption occurs at the county, township and village levels, it usually involves abuses of power by local officials.
This activism was interpreted as a sign of an emerging rule-of-law culture in China.
Legal activism in China is not unprecedented.
Their primary concern was the government’s interference in the legal process in its pursuit of the case.
That would help to ensure that three decades of legal reform is more bone and sinew than running water.
The RRR now stands at 18.5%, a historic high, even in global terms.
So it had to create something else to sell.
It created so-called “Central Bank Bills,” which commercial banks are supposed to buy voluntarily.
But China cannot reduce the volume of such bonds while it is running a large current-account surplus.
The renminbi-dollar exchange rate is, of course, only part of the story of what drives China’s trade competitiveness.
The changes are apparent not only in the statistics, but even more so in the faces of the people that one sees around the country.
China’s New Latin Beat
But Latin America should also be on its guard.
Ordinary people in Latin America are only now recognizing China’s importance as a global economic player.
Meanwhile, poverty rates in South America have remained relatively constant.
Since 2003, China has become Mexico’s most important trading partner after the United States.
MILAN – China is entering a complex set of transitions that will lay the foundations for the advanced-country status that it hopes to reach in the next 25 years.
Among these are:
(India will take on this problem in about a decade, as it continues on its rapid-growth path.)
In this transition, services will undoubtedly grow.
Targeting of sectors will decline.
The domestic market and a growing middle class will assume greater prominence.
These numbers are low and high, respectively, compared to other countries.
For China, this puts consumption in the range of 40-45% of GDP.
A big portion of these two income streams (corporate and government) needs to be redirected to the household sector.  
China’s Next Transformation
Unfortunately, China’s obsolete ideology plays a key role here.
A majority of Chinese dislike Kim Jong-il’s dynastic Leninist regime.
Indeed, among China’s elite no foreign-policy issue is more divisive.
China’s Perfect Storm
China\u0027s Political Bedlam
Forced removal into mental hospitals of many Falun Gong members is central to this campaign.
The twenty-or-more institutions of this type are run by the Ministry of Public Security and are subordinate provincial departments.
Another labor organizer, Cao Maobing, was committed more recently by police to a mental hospital in Jiangsu province.
The outside world is not helpless in fighting against China’s abuse of psychiatry.
China’s Political Storm
Thus, China’s government can pursue a policy of wai song nei jin – relaxed on the outside, vigilant internally.
They do not look like political reformers in the slightest.
They have not been heard from since.
Jiang Yanyong is no ordinary doctor.
Dr. Jiang, traumatized and anguished, nonetheless kept his silence.
But, I have decided to tell you all the facts."
China today is a contradiction.
Does this matter?
They must also freely be able to discuss the future and what kind of society they wish to see rise from the ashes of Mao’s revolution.
China\u0027s Reforms Stall Again
For example, legal scholar Cao Siyuan began writing on, lobbying for, and organizing conferences about constitutional reform.
It was clear that the reform bandwagon had hit a wall.
China is a large country, and it could not have succeeded as it has without widespread decentralization.
Market economies are not self-regulating.
But managing a market economy is no easy task.
China’s 11th five-year plan provides a roadmap for that response.
It flatly contradicts the repeated assurances of China’s leaders that China’s rise will bring only “harmony” and peace to the international community.
But since the 1980’s, the US has been ambivalent about the ultimate military and civilian utility of its space efforts.
Overseas, China’s role in places like Sudan and Burma not only draws international opprobrium, but also taints its reputation.
This has not gone unnoticed, as a wave of anti-China movements has spread across Africa.
Of course, interference in the internal affairs of another country isn’t inherently evil.
China now faces a dilemma.
China’s Short March
But then an unwelcome thing happened.
Gu was one of the first lawyers to receive her license.
Wang is no saint.
The wolves are now turning on each other.
China\u0027s Silent Rural Revolution
This is an internationally recognized level of "absolute disparity."
India, long known for gross disparities between rich and poor, has a Gini coefficient that has hovered around 0.30 to 0.32 over the past five decades.
So today's China is a much less equitable society than India.
Yet little changes.
When a government-run brick plant in Hongdong County of Shanxi Province was revealed to be using slave labor, a famous episode from a Beijing opera flashed through my mind.
China is now a society rotten to the core.
Four years ago, a college graduate named Sun Zhigang was arrested for walking on the streets of the city of Guangzhou.
He was beaten to death while in custody.
Seven years ago, a lawmaker from Hunan province went to Shanxi province to rescue slave workers from brick plants.
The socialism established by Mao Zedong has been replaced by a thoroughly cynical creed.
The former paradise of the poor has become a living hell for them.
And the corrupt officials?
Given centuries of turmoil in China, today’s leaders will do everything in their power to preserve stability.
It has worked like a charm.
I spent some time in Chongqing – a vast metropolitan area of more than 34 million people – last summer.
In China, such changes in language are no accident.
The recent high-speed rail debacle is a case in point.
In 2003, China built its first high-speed-rail project.
By the end of 2010, China’s operational high-speed-rail network surpassed 8,000 kilometers, with an additional 17,000 kilometers under construction.
By contrast, all Western countries combined took a half-century to build a total of 6,500 kilometers.
Similarly, Wang Yi, a law lecturer at Chengdu University who called for freedom of speech and association, was barred from teaching.
The liberal journal Strategy and Management was closed down.
Indeed, China officially considers several regions in Russia’s Far East to be only “alienated” from it.
In China’s relations with all of them, the potential use of military force was and remains an important factor.
Vladimir Putin needs his own “Nixon moment.”
The Renault-Nissan Alliance will support China’s ambition.
Nissan entered China in 2003, when Chinese consumers bought 4.5 million cars.
Skeptics said that Nissan was “late to the game” in China: the Chinese car market was supposedly fully saturated.
Back then, the world’s top automotive market was the United States, with Americans buying more than 16 million cars and trucks.
As in 2003, some observers say that China’s goals are overly ambitious, because the clean-car market will not grow so quickly.
But China may silence the skeptics once again.
Indeed, 16 of the world’s 20 worst cities for air pollution are in China.
In August, China committed about $290 billion to clean-energy projects.
China is also replacing government fleets with EVs.
The city of Shenzhen, in China’s Pearl River Valley, has 2,350 EVs in its municipal fleet.
Myanmar’s decision to shelve the Chinese-backed Myitsone Dam project shocked China.
Those interests include a new oil pipeline linking Myanmar to Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan province.
The Mekong incident tells another grim story.
The river, which links five countries, has been long famous as a setting for trans-national crimes such as drug trafficking, gambling, and smuggling.
China’s Turning Point
Simultaneously, continuing ethnic tensions between Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, and Han Chinese threatened to tear the region apart along local and tribal lines.
Its war against terrorism must be combined with a policy that gives them hope.
But it is also dangerous, because it derives from China’s old weaknesses rather than its new strengths.
China\u0027s Virtual Revolution
Online discussion of current events, especially through internet bulletin boards, is another new phenomenon.
But why did these disparities arise in the first place?
But the most fundamental problem is that development does not take place overnight.
During this long period, some get rich first, which means that others lag behind.
But none of this will solve the problem.
How can we face our ancestors?
As our tears flow down our cheeks, I do not dare believe that this is our country, the China that gave birth to me and raised me....
My life belongs to my country.
Let's wake you up.
Mother!
The government, believing that the situation in the countryside could not get worse, did not stop them.
China Stuck in the Net
There is nothing "virtual" about the problems China's communist rulers confront with the internet.
Although critical to China's goals of modernization and globalization, the internet threatens the political status quo.
The agenda is long, but it is hardly a secret.
But the clock is ticking.
It remains a blueprint that China’s new leadership cannot ignore.
Time is no longer on China’s side.
It must act now.
Chinese Finance Comes of Age
Current valuations put four Chinese banks in the global top ten by market capitalization.
Otherwise, the market knew best.
The Chinese were less ideological.
Chinese Shadows
Sometimes, that entails deliberate public spectacles.
They all have more money than can be explained by their official pay.
What was unusual about Bo was his open ambition.
Bo behaved more like an American politician.
After Mao himself died, his wife Jiang Qing was arrested and presented as a Chinese Lady Macbeth.
In fact, Bo’s fall from grace involves not only his wife, but his entire family.
This, too, is a Chinese tradition.
The family must take responsibility for the crimes of one of its members.
When that individual falls, so must they.
Choosing Mr. Europe
He won’t make waves, but he won’t make headlines either.
Then there’s Tony Blair.
The Pope of Japanese Finance
Japan’s stock market reacted favorably as well, rising almost 30% since the vote.
One day, Motonari asked each of them to snap an arrow, which they did without difficulty.
But when he then asked them to snap three arrows, none could do it.
The problem, from the start, was the third arrow.
Uncertainty reigned for a considerable time.
But he resisted ever setting such a “target.”
Its purpose is not to encourage the depreciation of the yen, despite complaints about the yen’s depreciation.
Japan, at long last, will not have to fight deflation with one hand tied behind its back.
There were many heroes of these battles in the emerging markets.
Politics is not always kind to good candidates.
Choosing to Learn
But there is nothing uniquely “Nordic” about this change.
On the contrary, it is one that others can emulate. 
After this system was adopted in the 1990’s, many non-public schools were established.
Companies operating chains of schools later came to play an important role as well.
The voucher system means that all students, irrespective of family income, can attend the school of their choice.
Chronicle of a Currency Crisis Foretold
Why, then, is the United States able to operate with a single currency, despite major differences among its 50 states?
When the textile and shoe industries in America’s northeastern states died, workers moved to the West, where new industries were growing.
And, obviously, only 16 nations within the 27-member EU’s free-trade area use the euro.
This goal is now within reach.
In a few other countries, the disease has been sporadically reintroduced by travelers from regions where polio has not yet been eliminated.
Change is an attack on representative democracy.
Social redistribution of resources is a task for the state, and the central state's responsibility in this field must not be diffused.
In this respect, there is a similarity between economics and politics.
Civil society is one of the key ways in which our human nature can be exercised in its entirety.
In Russia in particular, the situation is mixed.
Consider health care.
Of course, many of those statistics are not even collected, yet alone published.
In the United States, people are already rating their own doctors at sites such as RateMDs.com and vitals.com; third-party doctor and hospital ratings are available at HealthGrades.com.
Today, that type of information is called “healthy lifestyle promotion.”
If not, she could be referred to a local clinic.
Civilization (singular) is, on the contrary, an evaluative moral category: the opposite of barbarism.
No civilization is possible without it.
This plurality of cultures usually does not present any problems for us, because shifting from one cultural code to another is a universal human faculty.
Moreover, cultures related to a given territory are never really “pure”.
For the moment, politics has claimed paramount status.
Clarity about Diamonds
PRINCETON – Diamonds have an image of purity and light.
The Marange diamond field, discovered in 2006, is one of the richest ever found.
Soon after the field was discovered, the Zimbabwean military took control of the area.
Nigeria and Angola are other glaring examples of countries that have failed to use their oil wealth for the benefit of their people.
In effect, the poor are aiding the rich.
The benefits of conservation to the world as a whole far exceed the value of exploitation to a country like Papua New Guinea (PNG).
The PNG government would like to do the right thing, to maintain its natural capital for future generations.
But officials there believe that that they have currently no choice.
Countries like PNG would thus be doubly better off if they cut down their ancient hardwood trees and replanted.
But this makes no sense economically or socially.
(There are, as always, technical issues to be resolved, concerning monitoring and measurement, but these can be overcome easily with modern technologies.)
But, can we wait?
From a global point of view, the best use of these resources is to maintain the forests, which is even possible with managed cutting.
River basin organizations such as that established for the Nile, Niger, or Senegal rivers help facilitate dialogue between states that share hydraulic resources.
Where they do not exist, they should be created in partnership with all the countries concerned.
Yet international water conflicts are only one side of the coin.
Chad risks falling prey to the same cycle of violence.
Water consumption also must be addressed.
Only about 0.5% of the world’s energy comes from these renewable sources.
Moreover, renewables are still costly.
Climate change is as much a matter of security as it is an economic and human concern.
So what should be done?
Regulatory policy can increase the efficiency of appliances, housing, and machinery.
The IPCC has produced a good report – an attempt to summarize what the world’s scientists know about global warming.
In the 1980’s, America’s Environmental Protection Agency expected oceans to rise by several metres by 2100.
By the 1990’s, the IPCC was expecting a 67-centimeter rise.
Six years ago, it anticipated ocean levels would be 48.5 centimeters higher than they are currently. In this year’s report, the estimated rise is 38.5 centimeters on average.
We desperately need a global deal.
The Protocol is not a perfect instrument.
But it is part of international law, and that is vital.&#160;
A similar shift in global public opinion is occurring with respect to climate change.
India’s environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, declared: “There is a fine line between climate science and climate evangelism.
Clipping the Euro’s Wings
After all, comparable goods often sell internationally at very different prices.
This strategy does  not imply that central banks should attempt to confine the exchange rate to a pre-specified target zone.
This clone, however, will never leave the British laboratory in which it was created. 
It is rather like a Woody Allen script, but run backwards.
The nucleus from a human cell is inserted into an egg that had its nucleus removed.
An embryo forms, but it will not be implanted in a uterus.
Instead, embryonic stem cells will be derived from its inner cell mass.
Stem cells cannot become a baby. 
This probably explains why at least some animal clones have problems with their hearts, lungs, and immune systems.
Weight is a problem too.
The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson is not the only British celebrity on a diet. 
The idea behind a slippery slope is that if you do x, which is acceptable, you will end up doing y, which is not.
The former would be done in order to save lives by treating diseases now incurable – say, Parkinson's, ALS, and multiple sclerosis.
The cells created through cloning would be an extension of the patient: a means to treat him with cells generated by his own body.
PARIS: Three types of recessions exist.
Those of the second type are minor and relatively easy to repair if not to avoid.
All that they usually require is a reduction in interest rates or a bit of reflation.
Is America facing this third type of recession?
The savings rate for households has gone from 5% of American GDP in 1990 to zero in 2000.
All of these reforms demand coordination with NATO.
In the 1990's, the US devoted 2.8% of GDP annually on R&D, compared with 2.3% in Germany, 2% in the UK, and 1.9% in France.
Because weakness in research is not--at least not primarily--a funding issue.
But funding is only part of the problem.
Admittedly this is not true in all fields: the study of Ancient Greek fragments is valuable even it meets hardly any demand.
It would be more credible when it demands to be heard at international bargaining tables, particularly vis-à-vis the US, and it would stimulate scientific research.
Coexistence or No Existence
The conflict has been called “A Clash of Civilizations.”
Instead we must try to build bridges between religions, ethics and norms.
Call it self-censorship if you wish.
They are not open to values other than their own.
They want confrontations.
or no existence
Coke Is It in Europe
There is plenty of anecdotal evidence indicating traces of cocaine found on bank notes and in water supplies.
Now it is 40%.
First, drug users in Europe are switching to cocaine from heroin.
It is seen as a drug for winners, not losers.
To many it is a symbol of success, until they end up in a hospital or treatment center.
The Andean region has less than 1% of the world’s land area, but more than 15% of its plant life.
Sweden is a good example of how to do it right.
Some 50,000 Soviets – writers, journalists, officials, musicians, dancers, athletes, and academics – visited the United States between 1958 and 1988.
Aleksandr Yakovlev was strongly influenced by his studies at Columbia University in 1958.
Some popular music lyrics can have political effects.
Cultural messages can also be conveyed by the way that sports teams or stars conduct themselves, or in the multiple images purveyed by television or cinema.
Pictures often convey values more powerfully than words.
Even the consumption of fast food can make an implicit statement.
Even rock and roll played a part.
In 1980, after John Lennon was murdered, a monument to him spontaneously appeared in Prague, and the anniversary of his death was marked by an annual procession for peace and democracy.
In 1988, the organizers founded a Lennon Peace Club that demanded the removal of Soviet troops.
Lennon trumped Lenin.
The Cold War was won by a mixture of hard and soft power.
Not all of the sources of soft power were American – witness the role of the BBC and the Beatles.
Eastern European cultures were more similar to Western cultures than are Muslim cultures.
How to Beat Childhood Cancer
PHILADELPHIA – For a parent, there is perhaps no greater fear than the prospect of losing a child to illness or accident.
Looking at the five-year survival rates for children with ALL from the 1970’s through the 1990’s, one sees an almost linear improvement in cure rates.
Colombia and the International Crisis
This comparatively benign situation reflects Colombia’s relatively favorable macroeconomic conditions.
Colombia at Peace?
West Africa, too, would be affected, having become in recent years the main transit point for South American drugs headed to Europe.
Colombia’s Eternal Agony
Colombia’s New Dawn
But no more.
There have, indeed, been many human-rights violations in Colombia.
Once these atrocities were discovered, the government dealt with them swiftly.
This, of course, does not make the killings more palatable.
What US lawmakers should do, however, is to help make the decline in violence irreversible.
The danger, then, is a failure to deliver the knockout blow at a time when the group appears to be disintegrating.
For more than a quarter century, Israeli policy has been in conflict with that of the United States and the international community.
This policy was reconfirmed even by Israel in 1978 and 1993, and emphasized by all American presidents, including George W. Bush.
In breast cancer or melanoma, for example, recurrences 25 years after initial treatment have been reported.
We also have evidence that says that these dormant cells may resist most current treatments.
Our knowledge of the regulation of tumor dormancy is really in its infancy.
Would intermittent therapy be as useful as long-term treatment?
We also need to understand better the prevalence of long-term dormant disease in patients.
How common is the phenomenon we are examining?
It may be that many cancer patients harbor disseminated tumor cells, and not all of these cells are destined to re-awaken.
Coming Out in Africa
A country of 20 million people, Ghana is unusually tolerant.
Whites, Asians, and Middle Easterners mix well.
One gay man has his own television show, even though his sexual preferences are no secret.
The paper that reported the story is owned by the government and sells more copies than all other newspapers combined.
The Norwegian posted the photos on the Web and supposedly mailed printouts to his Ghanaian friends.
No African man is supposed to be gay, and physical contact between men is presumed to be innocent.
In sub-Saharan Africa, I am reminded of the saying that silence is golden.
They require other social institutions to support them.&#160;
The history of capitalism has been a process of learning and re-learning these lessons.&#160; Adam Smith’s idealized market society required little more than a “night-watchman state.”
This “mixed-economy” model was the crowning achievement of the twentieth century.
Designing the next capitalism will not be easy.
May 9th will be the mother of all celebrations in Moscow.
But to the three Baltic countries the end of WWII led to half a century of occupation and lost opportunities.
It was produced by a huge team of scientists working in different disciplines and different parts of the United States.
What is good for one part of the country, or indeed one part of the world, might be a disaster for another.
For example, the report relies on two different mathematical models of the atmosphere.
His reflections elicited nothing if not mixed reactions.
Sympathizers acknowledged the contradictions of a system in which a national unit is used internationally.
It is a composite accounting unit in which the IMF issues credits to its members.
They cannot be used to intervene in foreign-exchange markets, or in other transactions with market participants.
There is also the convenience factor: dollars are widely used in a variety of other transactions.
It could issue its own SDR-denominated bonds. Better still, it could encourage other G-20 countries to do likewise.
But nothing is free.
Again, there would be a cost.
Even now they won’t materialize overnight.
Common Sense on Capital Controls
SANTIAGO – Few policy debates are stranger than the one concerning capital controls.
Am I the only one who finds this logic a bit crooked?
When dealing with surges of potentially destabilizing capital inflows, capital controls are a no-no, but something called prudential regulation is quite okay.
For an economist, this is cause for celebration – no cocktail required.
Getting to Normal
This was the case in the US.
That guarantee has insured investors against their biggest risk.
The new Egypt will not allow this.
Completing the G-20’s Agenda
Compute To Compete
But this alone will not suffice.
But I fear that the steps needed to emulate Estonia’s achievements may not be very welcome elsewhere in the EU.
Now that Estonia’s competitiveness can no longer count on a low-cost labor force, it needs to generate new technologies.
Lack of competition within the EU also has security implications.
More questions arise from the policy response to the subsequent recession.
How can his successors know less than he did?
It may even be the case that we ought to return to the much more tightly regulated financial system of the first post-World War II generation.
Confronting Fear
What is going on?
Absolutely not.
Consumption is dropping, and companies are cutting investment.
Emerging-market countries face an additional problem.
But the recent prosperity of many of these countries has come from access to global capital.
The IMF has the wherewithal to commit up to $250 billion.
The supply of water is also highly variable across regions and within countries, with floods and droughts occurring at irregular times. 
Because the world is now pretty much filled up, there are few opportunities to expand the physical supply of resources.
- Conserve irrigation water.
Another way of improving irrigation efficiency is by developing crops that produce more food with the same, or less, water.
- Exploit advanced desalination.
Urban areas typically dispose of about 85% of their fresh-water intake as wastewater, often in neighboring water bodies.
The wastes could be treated and used to replenish groundwater.
- Develop creative pricing policies for urban water and wastewater.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson is to be replaced by the Brazilian Sergio Vieira de Mello, a longtime UN diplomat, on September 12 th .
During the past year, for the first time in its history, the US was not a member of the Commission (though it will be regaining its seat in 2003).
Confused by the Veil
On July 23 millions of Turks will wake up into a new, post-elections Turkey.
In the 1920’s and 1930’s – the years of Atutűrk’s rule &#45;&#45; the “new Turkish women” became the icon of the modern, secular regime.
At the first glance there seems to be a huge mental, cultural and political gap dividing Turkey’s women.
Yet if we look closer this gap becomes illusory.
Sometimes among two best friends, one is covered and one is not.
Some wear it out of habit or for traditional reasons rather than religious ones.
Congo’s Infinite War
Not anymore: currently, Congo’s eastern province of North Kivu is in the headlines almost every day.
Connecting the Solutions
We sense it every day in the news.
Policymakers have offered prescriptions for solving it.
Emerging markets and other developing countries will need oxygen in the form of credit lines and trade financing.
We need solutions to each that are solutions to all.
The information-and-communications-technology (ICT) revolution is surely the most powerful single force for economic development in the world today.
It is not just in New York, Shanghai, or Paris that one finds a mobile telephone in the hands of each passerby.
An estimated 250 million subscribers live in Sub-Saharan Africa alone.
Within minutes of going online in a pastoralist community in northeast Kenya, kids were reading about their own community as part of the Africa-wide Millennium Villages Project.
On the horizon in two directions, spaced at around four kilometers, were the mobile towers to connect the new school with the world.
The promise was not lost on the national government.
EMU was designed to encourage structural reforms.
Consequences of the Iraq War
Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction;
UN inspections were not eliminating that threat;
The fourth claim will be subject to wild propaganda on both sides.
Even in those circumstances, war might well have been unwise compared to a policy of containment.
Conservative Interventionism
Yet, today’s crisis has not led to the establishment of such financial institutions.
So I wonder: why didn’t the US Congress follow the RFC/RTC model when authorizing George W. Bush’s and Barack Obama’s industrial and financial policies?
Conservatives for Obama
Let’s give the other party a chance, even if its policies are not exactly what conservatives may like.
It’s a great line and it applies.
That’s a lot better than what we have today.
Consolidation or Competition for Financial Regulators?
Two?
Perhaps three or four?
No one will be confused as to who is responsible.
Fine, as far as it goes.
Yes, this sounds messy, and may duplicate work or become overly compartmentalized.
(It's nearly impossible to explain the details to anyone who hasn't been an American financial regulator or a lawyer.)
But the system works.
In fact, it works pretty well, though mistakes do occur (as they do in any regulatory system).
Where are the alternatives?
But we are a small minority.
The question is: what must the cutters and slashers believe to justify their policies?
In other words, there can never be involuntary, or unwanted, unemployment.
The calculus of probability…was supposed to be capable of reducing uncertainty to the same calculable status as certainty itself…”
Yet it happened.
Unless we start discussing economics in a Keynesian framework, we are doomed to a succession of crises and recessions.
Take the European Union.
That project has still not been completed, but the missing bits are a continuing process, not a new idea.
None of it has been very successful.
Indeed, none of it has an advocate of the stature of Delors.
Scotland has a parliament, Wales an assembly.
English regions may soon follow.
But there are at least two exceptions to this suspicion.
Britain is a good example of the confusions that attend mere pragmatism.
Scotland may have a new (and expensive) government, but what about the English regions?
Are the East Midlands really an appropriate unit of self-government?
Where lies the right answer between a Scottish solution and a Chechen non-solution?
Containment, not Appeasement
America made comparable errors in Guatemala and elsewhere in Latin America.
Containment against Libya was not appeasement.
It should have been the model in Iraq, as it now should be the model in Iran.
Instead, defenders of the contemporary equivalent of “rollback” advocate attacking Iran because it is developing nuclear weapons.
This makes about as much sense as it would to attack China in the 1950’s.
America must push for a solution that can garner the support of significant majorities of all the peoples between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean.
In such situations, action becomes more fluid.
It is the self-made part of luck.
That gap proved the difference between the success of the father and the failure of the son.
Controlling Chinese Television
The 2003 World Press Freedom report put out by the group Reporters without Borders ranks China 161st among 166 nations, somewhere between Iran and North Korea.
China Central Television (CCTV) alone has 12 channels (many broadcasting 24 hours a day), and employs about 3,000 people.
CCTV falls under the control of the Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television.
The result is a de facto separation between news and everything else.
In my experience, 99% of all censorship occurs with the writers and producers themselves.
Their failure would have dire consequences for the entire region.
Syria has a keen interest in being invited into an US-led settlement with Israel.
A Damascene conversion is not only possible, but is also vital for regional peace.
Convicts for Export
So far, however, China has failed to persuade the country’s president to lease it one of the 700 uninhabited Maldivian islands for use as a small base for the Chinese navy.
These regulations called for “local­ization,” including hiring local workers, respecting local customs, and adhering to safety norms.
The Human City
The tools needed to make urban life more sustainable are no longer flowing only from North to South and West to East.
China has taken the lead in exporting solar photovoltaic cells, while clean-tech parks are arising even in the Arab world.
Two US cities – New York and Seattle – have raised efficiency standards for new construction to record levels.
As a result, carpooling is gaining prevalence in cities like Berlin.
Information technology can also reduce stress on the transportation system.
And India has become a leader in converting biomass and food waste into energy.
One year after the Indian Ocean tsunami, what are the lessons?
Yet that asteroid was only about 200 feet in diameter.
Deflecting an asteroid from its orbit when it is still hundreds of millions of miles from Earth is a feasible undertaking.
Possibly.
At times, it almost looks as if anti-globalization protesters are taking over.
Capitalism is a public trust; it works if everybody has a fair chance and corporate theft receives highly visible punishments.
The ritual witch-hunt now underway may be the only way for bosses to regain their bearings.
Wittingly or unwittingly, individuals do things that injure other individuals.
The legal system has an important role here.
Immanuel Kant, with his categorical imperative, provided the philosophical foundations for those who wanted an alternative basis for ethics than that provided by religious aphorisms.
Much the same may be true about Iraq during the 1990's.
Corrupting the Fight Against Corruption
At its recent annual meeting, World Bank officials spoke extensively about corruption.
Life is never black and white.
In some cases, this may entail delivering assistance through non-governmental organizations.
Corruption: The Enemy Within
TBILISI: Corruption is a malignant tumor, removable only with pain.
For eight years I have governed, as president, an independent Georgia.
But this success, and the stability it brings, will be temporary if corruption continues, like corrosive acid, to eat away at the economy and the state.
The common courts and Supreme Court now have their own independent institutional basis in law.
But such a contrived "show trials" would have delivered no lasting benefits for Georgia.
Corruption is one of Africa's endemic problems.
But the weakest assumption about the benefits of a small state centers around the pace at which institutions develop.
But there are limits to this.
Fifty-four percent of Americans now say that the US erred in sending troops, up from 24% at the start of the war in March 2003.
Iraq differs from Vietnam in another way as well.
Even then, success is uncertain.
Even then, success took seven years.
It is not today.
They would run down their trade surpluses and, in some cases, allow their currencies to appreciate.
Counting Iraqi Casualties
That being said, the group reported that the CDR increased from 5.5 per thousand people in 2002 to 13.3 per thousand in the post-invasion period (March 2003-March 2006).
Do they really provide us with more information than the Iraq Body Count figures provide?
For now, that is about all that statistics can safely tell us.
Cradle of Contradictions
So far, Syria's authorities have not reacted to the Tharwa Project.
It's probably still too early in the game for that.
What will happen to Argentina in the next 25 years?
But the demonstration effect would be immediate.
Finland was the first to issue national inflation-indexed bonds, in 1946, in response to massive wartime price growth.
Writing the Future
ADDIS ABABA – What does the future hold for the global economy?
Like a novel with two possible endings, ours is a story yet to be written in this new century.
Droughts afflicted around 60% of US counties, including the breadbasket states of the Midwest and the Great Plains.
In October, an extraordinary “superstorm” smashed into the Atlantic coastline around New Jersey, causing losses of around $60 billion.
Unfortunately, this is simply not the case.
“If we’d been for it, it probably would have happened. But we weren’t, so it didn’t.”
Creative Europe
The Lisbon Strategy owes much to the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, who claimed that profit results from innovation.
But in post-industrial societies, consumers look for more in a product than just functionality.
It is at least as much an art as it is a science, and it goes beyond technical and business innovation.
World-class design and brands already have a foothold in Europe, where creative industries are stronger that the car industry.
In a word, no.
Pension funds, mutual funds, and investment banks are all long in the stock market.
In this respect, CDSs are unique.
While painful for the rest of society, this is healthy.
Medical tests, too, often bring bad news, but abolishing medical testing does not solve problems, it only hides them, making them worse.
The reason that politicians and corporate managers alike hate CDSs is precisely because CDS rates are so useful and so prompt in exposing their mistakes.
Nobody likes to be found wrong.
Of course, the CDS market is not perfect.
In fact, it is not really an organized market, but only an informal virtual exchange.
Credit Where Credit is Due
But that savings number hides something very critical.
Indeed, private consumption in China has been growing in real terms at an annual rate of around 10% for the last seven years.
But why wait until 2010?
Crime and Punishment, Refugee Style
Corruption, indeed, now seems to be the society’s engine.
There remain in Romania today disadvantaged and neglected groups who are pushed to society’s sordid margins.
Was poverty the cause of his juvenile offenses in Romania and his crime in Italy?
When I visited Barcelona and Madrid last year, I was delighted to receive enthusiastic news about the successes of the growing Romanian community in these cities.
Europe deserves to prove that it is a real community, one diverse, democratic, spiritual, free, and prosperous.
Criminal Genes?
Are there genes for alcoholism?
We use the word to mean many different types of behaviour.
Yet Brunner's paper was published in one of the world’s most prestigious journals to considerable publicity. 
Much attention was devoted to its report that each of these ‘violent’ individuals also carried a mutation in the gene coding for the enzyme monoamine oxidase‚ (MAOA).
Yet the paper is now widely cited, and what was described in its title as ‘abnormal’ now becomes ‘aggressive behaviour.’
LONDON – Last year’s Libor scandal was a shock to the body politic in London.
Bankers don’t like it, but they have not yet left for more congenial locations.
Nor do they indicate that they will.
Frankfurt and Paris, the most plausible European competitors, languish in tenth and 26th place, respectively.
Criminal laws targeting all HIV carriers, however, are counter-productive and inherently unjust.
AIDS has claimed more than 25 million lives since medical scientists first identified it in 1981.
Which statement is true and which is false?
There is much to be said--once again--for the British system.
But is the British system fair?
The "Thatcher Revolution" was never supported by more than 43% of those who voted.
It is often said that Germany in particular needs what one former German president called a push ( Ruck ) to mobilize the dormant forces of its people.
All of this hinders foreign investment and access to international credit.
But there is also a theatrical intensity about the Argentine character: we are dramatic like the tango and somber like the novels of Ernesto Sábato.
She and her husband had hit upon a novel scheme: alternating power between them every four years.
Now a widow, she is exposed to the lame-duck syndrome, since she can’t be re-elected again.
Croatia after Tudjman
ZAGREB: Franjo Tudjman’s death, like his life, was a bizarre parody of Marshal Tito.
Tito provided the only leadership model that resonated with him.
In fact, they are bitter rivals and will divide opposition vote at the January 3 elections for the lower house of the Parliament (Sabor).
That is a luxury that Croatia cannot afford.
Crony capitalism American-style
The unfolding Enron scandal brings new meaning to two favorite American sayings: ``What goes around comes around,'' and ``People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.''
No transparency here.
Crony capitalism is not new; nor is it the province of a single party.
Auditing is intended to put limits on potential abuses.
Auditors desire to maintain their reputation.
Investors need assurance that information received adequately reflects the economic situation of a firm.
HONG KONG – Joseph Yam, the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and a career civil servant, is retiring.
While imperial in origin, the rationale behind the Currency Board was sound.
Colonies were short on expertise.
This was precisely what the British empire-builders had wanted to prevent.
Yam is the highest-paid civil servant in the world, earning US$1.5 million last year.
Anything else merely opens the door for corruption.
Cross-Border Banking in the Balance
The stakes could not be higher.
Many questions have yet to be answered about the design; implementation will be at least as challenging.
On balance, this is a good thing.
As with the Vienna Initiative, a “Vienna 2.0” would require commitments by all concerned parties.
For many banks, this happens naturally – their subsidiaries, as important value creators, are critical to their business models.
Crouching Tiger or Paper Dragon?
He pointed particularly to the PLA's increasing number of short-, intermediate- and even long-range ballistic missiles.
The prevailing consensus is not to regard China as a threat.
Cry, Beloved Burma
YANGON – Religious orders of monks have been the face of Burma ever since Buddhism was introduced here more than 1,000 years ago.
For a monk to involve himself in politics or to hold a political post is contrary to the ethical code of Theravada Buddhism.
More than 1,000 are missing, and many are presumed dead.
Burma is a country rich in natural resources, but its people are poor.
And it is not only the monks who are united.
They have attacked monasteries and arrested monks and nuns by force.
That is what the junta wants the world to think.
Cry, the Newborn Baby
In particular, integrated planning is essential.
This Americanization was often described simply as "globalization."
Much of the world began to turn away from the American way of doing business.
According to one recent calculation, 17 of the biggest 100 companies in Germany are in family hands, 26 in France, and 43 in Italy.
Unlike Messier, the Lagardères were seen as deeply French.
Indeed, in Italy, Fiat had long been in a sad decline.
They provided a highly efficient means of obtaining information about markets, suppliers, and sources of finance.
New brands can assert themselves by acquiring symbolic capital.
In the corporate landscape, there is the old, say, Coca Cola, but also alongside it the new, say, Microsoft or Amazon.
In this vision of how corporations work, the company that isn't globally dominant is an also-ran.
Cuba’s Back
Two fundamental considerations come to mind, and their ramifications in “up-for-grab” countries in Latin America, such as El Salvador, are particularly significant.
The first consideration involves the ALBA countries’ conduct of foreign policy.
They will not do so any time soon, on any issue that may spring up, if it means confrontation with the ALBA countries.
Cultivating Energy
Since the Neolithic (or late Stone Age) period, humans have been cultivating this “biomass” in order to feed itself.
Biomass, on the other hand, has several advantages.
Supplies of it are large and available throughout the world.
Widely used during World War II, this technology has since advanced considerably. 
Oil’s price reflects its extraction, refining, and distribution costs, but not that of creating the raw material.
Like a battery that runs out and is then recharged by the sun, this supply is renewable indefinitely, as long as it is managed properly.
Residue from forest, agricultural, and agro-industrial activities could be collected and converted.
However, in many places, energy cropping would certainly compete with food crops.
The UN Environment Program (UNEP) is embarked on a misguided campaign to ban the pesticide DDT under its Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) Framework Convention.
Mosquitoes soon hit back and endemic malaria returned to India.
The late Julian Simon provided a tart response to this bit of weak reasoning.
Environmentalists ban DDT because they are willing to sacrifice human lives for those of birds. 
The streets seemed alive with people.
People thrusting their hands through the taxi window, begging.
People herding animals.
People, people, people." 
It must be resisted as fiercely as the Christian crusaders of yore.
This new treatment targets only the tumor cells and is unlikely to affect other healthy cells in the body.
Chemical inhibition of the PARP1 protein results in reduced occurrence of these single-strand break repairs.
However, these breaks disrupt and damage the DNA when they are copied as DNA replicates.
Only those cells losing this remaining functional allele of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene will become tumors.
But caution is in order.
The adjustment that needs to take place is blocked.
But it can help the search for a solution.
That is no surprise, as European central bankers are the most conventional in their thinking and have been the most obsessed with inflation.
But, as Friedman would have argued, the two methods should be considered polar opposites.
Less spending means that the government will be smaller.
Also, countries with per capita incomes above $4,000 would also be cut back from World Bank loans.
CAMBRIDGE – In August 2008, Russian troops moved into Georgia.
The so-called “love bug virus,” launched in the Phillipines in 2000, is estimated to have cost billions of dollars in damage.
Terrorists, too, can exploit new vulnerabilities in cyberspace to engage in asymmetrical warfare.
But it was difficult to prove the source of the attack, and the Pentagon had to shut down some of its computer systems. 
That job will not be easy, because much of the relevant infrastructure is not under direct government control.
Nor will defensive measures like constructing electronic firewalls and creating redundancies in sensitive systems.
It is far cheaper and quicker to move electrons across the globe than to move large ships long distances.
Cycling and Cancer
The cyclist Lance Armstrong recently celebrated an anniversary.
Doctors diagnosed him with testicular cancer.
By 1998, he was again riding his bicycle. 
When he resumed serious training, he was leaner and more muscular.
In 1999, less than three years after his diagnosis, Armstrong won his first Tour de France.
When I race I don’t want to lose.
Unfortunately, in the world of cancer, this may not be so.
Oh, and there are those seven bike races that he won. 
So, is Europe chasing its tail?
Cyprus’s Last Best Chance
While he has lost his parliamentary majority, Talat is still head of the Turkish Cypriot administration and will continue to lead negotiations on behalf of the north.
They have seen too many previous efforts fail.
Opening up the debate about what peace could look like would help.
Second, strengthening links between the two communities is essential.
A Grand Unified Economic Theory?
But relegating free-market principles to the past would simply create a new set of imbalances.
Only then will productive discourse – the kind that does not end in government shutdown – be possible.
Damming China’s Rivers
Nowhere are consequences of this struggle clearer than in the Himalayan foothills of the southwestern province of Yunnan.
Yunnan is home to three great Asian rivers: the Mekong, the Salween (or Nu), and the Jinsha.
All start on the great Tibetan Plateau and flow in parallel through the northwest corner of the province into Southeast Asia.
The sun was high above white-crowned Jade Dragon Snow Mountain when my guide pointed down the gorge at the brown waters churning thousands of feet below.
“It will be very bad for us.
The dam will have its uses.
Dianchi Lake near the provincial capital, Kunming, is so shrunken and polluted that the city faces a serious water shortage.
Since 1949, 16 million people have been displaced by reservoirs.
Some 10 million of them still live in poverty.
Among the suspended projects was the first dam across the Nu/Salween.
The government recently called for more balanced development, even proposing a “green index” to measure growth.
But either outcome would be preferable to something in between – neither fish nor fowl.
This is a key development.
This is not a theoretical proposition.
Even in the unlikely event that colonization encountered no political resistance, it would not lead to a very efficient banking system.
At least the eurozone would get some stability.
Daniel Ortega Rides Again
This will be Ortega’s fifth run for the presidency, having lost his last three attempts.
US Undersecretary of State for Latin America Roger Noriega responded by calling Ortega a “hoodlum.”
But this is only half right.
To Ortega, such a posture reeks of betrayal, social democratic aberrations and imperialist tendencies.
Darkness at Darfur
Darfur itself is a region of Western Sudan comprised of Arab and African Muslims.
This is arguably genocide, a word used by the U.S. government but by few others to describe what is going on in Darfur.
UN Security Council Resolution 1564, passed on 18 September 2004, reserves the bulk of its criticism for the government of Sudan.
This principle is enshrined in various international documents, beginning with the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
There is a need for massive assistance to the displaced people of Darfur.
Darwin, the Greatest Psychologist
Before Darwin, philosophical speculation shaped our psychological understanding.
In a sense, sexual selection is the psychological extension of natural selection.
Peacocks have evolved to have long, colorful feathers simply because peahens have evolved to find them attractive.
Indeed, while natural selection is blind, sexual selection has an eye for beauty – although the nature of beauty is always in the eye of the beholder.
Given that human psychology has developed through a sometimes-uneasy balance of natural and sexual selection, evolution and psychology influence and interact with each other.
Sigmund Freud never met Darwin, but most of his mentors were enthusiastic Darwinists.
Darwin himself was the Darwin of the mind; Freud was his great popularizer.
But most of these developments have been derivative elaborations of Darwin’s grand evolutionary model.
Members of the UK Independence Party even think that Britain would do better, as do a considerable number of Conservative “Euro-skeptics.”
They dream of Britain as a kind of Singapore of the West, a commercial powerhouse ruled from the City of London.
The answer depends partly on nationality.
And yet, as memories of World War II fade, more and more people in the Netherlands and Scandinavia feel content to be under Germany’s powerful wings.
Culture still matters.
France is a different matter.
This, too, might have something to do with culture.
Like many French leaders, de Gaulle was deeply suspicious of the “Anglo-Saxons.”
In 1930, Winston Churchill said of his country: “We are with Europe, but not of it.” It is a sentiment still shared by many in Britain.
De Gaulle agreed.
This type of thinking has played a vital role in the development of European institutions.
He was obsessed by the ideal of unity.
How can one possibly share political authority with foreigners?
Many Europeans now resent the expanding powers of EU bureaucracy.
Ronald Reagan pioneered a wave of policy and propaganda in the United States in the 1980’s that demonized the National Endowment for the Arts.
Who needs to study languages and comparative literature?
West Point cadets do not.
They mold you for your future roles as the custodians of the nation’s defense.
Davos Man’s Depression
Equally striking was the loss of faith in markets.
So did inflation targeting: the excessive focus on inflation had diverted attention from the more fundamental question of financial stability.
And its automatic stabilizers, with spending automatically increasing as economic woes increased, held out the promise of moderating the downturn.
De Gaulle at the Barricades
Charles de Gaulle was born 120 years ago in Lille. He died 40 years ago at his home in Colombey-les-deux-Églises, expiring of a heart attack as he played solitaire one evening.
The war in Algeria played the key role in enabling de Gaulle to return to power in May 1958, at the age of 67.
What a business!”
Members of the presidential military staff were told to carry handguns.
If the army collapses, it is Algeria [and] France which collapses.”
The next day, de Gaulle’s face was drawn, but he was resolute and full of energy.
The Fifth Republic was safe, and a historic page had been turned.
De-Nationalizing the ECB’s Executive Board
The question is whether Germany will respond by claiming that it “owns” Issing’s portfolio as well as his chair.
Deadlock in Durban
A global killer is ripping through the world’s poorer countries largely unchecked.
Tobacco.
We know how to control tobacco use.
Indeed, even sharply reduced demand for tobacco would not mean unemployment in most countries.
But governments can counter it in several ways: local language warnings with a prominent tax stamp on cigarette packs are one example.
Recently, no less than William F Buckley has argued that nicotine addiction cannot be dismissed as free choice.
The Gates Foundation can fund action and research.
Death by Renminbi
They also affect the location of production and investment.
The scale of recent US trade deficits was always unsustainable, and the dollar has therefore fallen against the yen, euro, Brazilian real, and Australian and Canadian dollars.
Furthermore, the problem is not only America’s.
It is strange but true that even American unilateralism under President George W. Bush has not provoked a genuine debate over Europe’s future role in the world.
Death in Lhasa
Food could have been transported by rail within British India to save many starving people, but the British believed in a hands-off, laissez faire policy.
Starvation was part of nature.
They congratulated themselves on their stiff upper lips.
No, for the US is doing something similar.
Neither the US nor Europe has stepped forward with more money.
We need a plan, says the US; we cannot throw money at the problem.
The truth is simpler.
Few rich countries do better than the US.
In August, political leaders from the entire world will gather in Johannesburg for the World Summit on Sustainable Development.
Generals, it is said, always prepare to fight the last war – an old jibe, but one that contains an element of truth.
To begin with, what is meant by security?
So where do we go from here?
As a result, the creditors were no longer protected under global legal rules.
There were some who foresaw danger.
The Swedish economist Axel Leijonhufvud foresaw asset-price inflation – houses in particular – and a worsening of credit quality.
Financial innovation soon made that prediction come true.
As a result, America’s public debt has reached roughly 140% of GDP.
There is no newly emerging Great Power that can assume responsibility for global finance, as there was in 1914.
There is nothing special about using a year as that unit.
We should remember this from high school science: always pay attention to units of measurement.
Get the units wrong and you are totally befuddled.
They chose, without explanation, to divide debt-to-GDP ratios into the following categories: under 30%, 30-60%, 60-90%, and over 90%.
And it turns out that growth rates decline in all of these categories as the debt-to-GDP ratio increases, only somewhat more in the last category.
The lesson of 1688 was reinforced by the next European revolutionary wave.
For the past 20 years, it looked as if power was being shifted to a technocratic elite.
However, work to refit the carrier had already begun in Dalian, China’s main shipyard.
China also made a gift to Pakistan of 50 JF-17 fighter jets.
Decision Time for the Eurozone
As a result, fiscal consolidation becomes increasingly difficult to achieve, inviting renewed speculative attacks.
MILAN – In the dog days of summer, Milan is quieter than many European cities.
The locals are away, and, unlike Paris or Rome, tourists do not take their place.
The fires in Bangladeshi garment factories have raised new questions about the governance of global supply chains.
But the OMT program is dependent on German support.
Think now of an 8-cylinder engine running not on five cylinders, but on two or three at best.
Distortions will begin to unwind.
Saleh, who has been in power since 1978, knows that his time is up.
“They are falling like leaves in autumn,” he recently said of the regime’s defectors.
Perhaps more remarkably, in a country containing more than 12 million guns, the protesters have not fired a shot.
Democracy does not coexist with al-Qaeda.
Yemen is the Yemeni people.
We are Yemen.
Deepening NAFTA
Too often, the US has taken a unilateral approach.
There would be a massive run into cash, on an order not seen since the Great Depression, with long lines of people at ATMs and teller windows withdrawing as much as possible.
The only law that Congress cannot repeal is the law of unintended consequences.
The West must make it clear that Ukraine's geopolitical position isn't enough to guarantee continued support.
Ukraine has $3.1 billion in debt payments coming due in the year 2000.
I established a nonprofit foundation there in 1989, two years before the country became independent in 1991.
I shall continue my support for that foundation.
Now they claim to have manufactured nuclear weapons for self-defense.
Still, as in so many other countries, high tech was no magic bullet.
These problems, however, are not made in Delhi exclusively.
One problem is the dilution of ASW capability.
If Japan does decide to scale down its defense forces in this respect, a bold and qualitative change is inevitable.
Defining Terrorism
In the mid-20th century, Fascists were the evildoers.
Now terrorists have become the designated masters of malevolence.
The UN repeatedly passes resolutions against terrorism, but cannot agree on how to define the term.
Official definitions of terrorism are unpersuasive.
Can terrorists be soldiers or state agents?
Sometimes it is, sometimes not.
No American would be happy about branding the Boston Tea Party an act of terrorist aggression against British property.
What about the Stern gang's blowing up of Jerusalem's King David Hotel in order to liberate Palestine from the British?
Is there good terror and bad terror?
One reason is that terrorism is typically organized activity.
That makes them more frightening than ordinary criminals.
Effective terrorism always captures headlines.
Many definitions face this problem.
There may be no single common feature, but all are readily identified as members of the same family.
In the past, metallic money provided an inconvenient and unsatisfactory solution to the question of value.
It was inconvenient because gold was awkward for everyday transactions, and silver had too little value for major transfers. 
The arrival of silver from the New World in the sixteenth century triggered sustained inflation.
Deflation that emanates from the financial sector is lethal.
South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand will also see declines in consumer price levels.
But when prices are falling, the real interest rate exceeds the nominal rate.
If prices fall at a rate of 1%, could they fall at a rate of 10%?
What, then, can the US do to undermine Iran’s position?
“Let’s just remember that Iran is some 80% dependent on oil in its budget,” she said, so it is “not really able to live with a disruption.”
In September, Bush made an unexpectedly low-key speech to the UN General Assembly.
Administration officials should lower the political temperature.
Bush should invite Ahmadinejad to Washington. Better yet, invite him to Crawford.
Make him breakfast.
The planned Nord Stream gas pipeline on the bottom of the Baltic Sea is a good example of the problems that everyone in Europe is facing.
The pipeline has been established as a Russian-German-Dutch consortium, but it is the Russian energy giant Gazprom that is in the driver’s seat with 51% of the shares.
But Nord Stream is no “technical issue.”
This year is crucially important.
There are roughly 23,000 nuclear weapons today, which is 40,000 fewer than at the Cold War’s height. &nbsp;These weapons’ total yield is greater than 150,000 Hiroshima-size nuclear explosions.
But the road to global nuclear disarmament will be long and bumpy.
Nuclear weapons would thus become superfluous.
Demand or Supply?
CHICAGO – Economics is all about demand and supply.
Some progressive economists want even more.
From 1960 until 1991, recoveries from recessions in the US were typically rapid.
These states also tended to have the largest rise in unemployment rates between 2006 and 2009.
Hurst estimates that this “structural” unemployment may account for up to three percentage points of total unemployment.
Demilitarizing Muslim Politics
The military was responsible for Islam’s implantation throughout the Middle East, as well as in Persia, Southern Europe, and the Indian sub-continent.
Janissaries were not allowed to marry or to own property, which prevented them from developing loyalties outside of the imperial court.
Military domination in Muslim countries survived right up to the fall of the Ottoman Empire in the early twentieth century.
Democracy, Responsibility, and Honor
Blair also lost his ministers of foreign affairs and of development assistance, Robin Cook and Clare Short, respectively.
A Democratic Hurricane
NEW YORK – Nothing concentrates the mind like a full-blown crisis.
Rattling is all it did.
Salt water came streaming into open subways.
And that was just New York.
In parts of New Jersey, many people fortunate enough still to have a house are cut off by rivers of raw sewage lapping at their doors.
Silvio Berlusconi was one such figure.
Democracy at Bay
Five years ago, 90% of Israelis supported democracy; today the number is 77%.
Democracy Begins At Home
Beyond elections, citizens can provide an effective check on government only if they are well informed.
This is three times the amount original projected by the Bush administration.
Democracy also requires recognizing the rights of individuals.
America’s democracy remains the envy of much of the world, and it is good that the Bush administration now champions the expansion of democracy forcefully.
Democracy Comes Second
Democracy is slowly spreading around the world.
But this correlation goes missing when one looks at the dimension of time rather than space.
This applies to the episodes of democratization in Latin America and the Philippines in the mid-1980’s, but also to Turkey in the early 1980’s and Nepal in 1990.
Nor are the apparent exceptions proof to the contrary.
The paradox here is that parties have become more tribal having lost their ideological distinctiveness.
Sometimes they never see the desired results.
Some want to cut through the tangle with more direct democracy.
Democracy in Distress
They seem to be structurally condemned to short-termism.
Chinese think long term because they are Chinese, not because they are not democrats.
Bring Back Egypt’s Elected Government
In late 2011 and early 2012, Egypt held parliamentary elections.
The World Bank’s designation as a “bank” understates its importance and its multifaceted roles.
Democracy in Tea Party America
So one can only wonder what he would have made of the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida.
The rich – and only the rich – “built” what they have.
Democracy on the Nile?
Many people have long argued that democratization in the Middle East will not get far until Egypt becomes fully engaged in the process.
Mubarak, after all, is already in his 24th year as president.
Turkey at one end of the Middle East and Morocco at the other are already well on their way.
The recent wave of popular pressure appears to have shaken the regime.
For example: on January 1, 2010, I think to myself that the game will soon be up for the Greeks.
Voilà – a successful “short” trade.
This would be a reasonable conclusion if financial markets always, or even usually, priced assets correctly.
But they do no such thing.
So why should we believe that the markets have been correctly pricing the risk of Greek, Irish, or Portuguese debt?
Nationalism is the classic expression of thwarted democracy.
Democracy’s Drama in Terrorism’s Theater
Most US presidents since Woodrow Wilson have made similar statements.
While free and fair elections are important, liberal democracy is more than “electocracy.”
Freedom House, a non-governmental organization, listed 86 free countries at the beginning of the Bush years, a total that increased slightly, to 89, by the end of his term.
Democracy remains a worthy and widespread goal, which should be distinguished from the means chosen to attain it.
Equally important to the foreign-policy methods used to support democracy abroad are the ways in which we practice it at home.
When we try to impose democracy, we tarnish it.
This approach is what Ronald Reagan called the “shining city on the hill.”
Terrorism is a form of theater.
It works not by sheer destruction, but rather by dramatizing atrocious acts against civilians.
Democracy versus the Eurozone
All variants of Eurobonds come with supposedly strong conditionality.
Democracy Without Democrats
The philosopher Karl Popper had ample reason to propose a precise definition of democracy.
Today democracy has to mean "elections plus" - but plus what?
When Hitler came to power in January 1933, many if not most German democrats thought: "Let him!
"Elections plus" must mean, therefore, democracy plus the rule of law.
Democratic Alliances
One was the democratic reconstruction of Europe after WWII, and the other was victory in the Cold War.
Indeed, that passion shows little sign of waning.
The US state of California, which has become increasingly dysfunctional since a 1978 popular referendum capped property taxes, can attest to that.
Democratic Inequality
In May 2003, the investment bank Goldman Sachs created options markets for home prices, for the UK as a whole and for Greater London, with both to be traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Someday, these two institutions will be brought together in one country.
Moreover, it is only one example of the democratization of finance now underway.
Databases are rapidly improving in depth, and are becoming more deeply integrated with personal financial-planning Web sites.
With modern computers and information technology, it will be possible to deal individually with a million different risks.
Each year, for example, developing countries miss out on $124 billion in revenue from offshore assets held in tax havens.
But human rights are not just symbols; they are also tools.
This removes the stigma of charity, and it is empowering for victims.
This strategy enabled China to test nuclear bombs in the 1960’s and launch satellites in the 1970’s.
But China was still a poor, agrarian economy; it held no comparative advantage in capital-intensive industries.
Haste made waste.
Now China is the world’s largest exporter and its second largest economy, and more than 600 million people were pulled out of poverty.
As a result, full democracy is to be permitted only in 2007.
For Hong Kong, the only good system is democracy.
Of course, Deng’s policy can work only if Beijing wants it to work.
Unfortunately, Beijing has other ideas.
Then came Tung’s resignation as Chief Executive in March.
But he was not popular because the public viewed him as a puppet of China and a crony of big developers, particularly Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong’s richest person.
This is the doctrine that Krugman argues is no longer sufficient for our age.
Higher Education Misconceived
The same attitudes are manifest in other countries as well.
Designer Diets?
The problem, for scientists and consumers alike, is that the benefits are not the same for everyone.
This is the science of nutrigenomics.
It consists of two strings – formed from phosphate and sugar – along which four unique chemical compounds (DNA bases) are attached.
Within the genetic code, there are 30,000-40,000 highly organized regions called genes.
The resulting product, for example eye color, is your phenotype.
This includes our risk of developing a host of age-related diseases.
Genes code for proteins, the body’s workers, which are not made directly from DNA, because they do not speak the same language.
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) acts as an interpreter in a process called transcription (the reading of genes).
Determining the structure of DNA and the sequence of the human genome has revolutionized biology and medicine.
Designing Regulatory Failure
Deterring Arab Democracy
That was the case in Algeria in 1991-92, in Iraq in 2005, and in the West Bank and Gaza in 2006.
There, too, Islamists have immediately filled it.
The US is not the only guilty party.
An even more telling case is Saudi Arabia.
Devaluing Life
Indeed, it would be hard for the current administration to say that it wouldn’t do the same thing again, because it has done it many times before.
Again, one of many examples will suffice.
On April 5, 2003, a civilian neighborhood in Basra was bombed.
One bomb hit the home of the Hamoodi family, a respected, educated family, none of whose members belonged to the ruling Baath Party.
We can be quite sure that American forces would not have acted in the same way if the civilians nearby had been other Americans.
Is it possible to ensure an adequate supply of safe blood once and for all?
And donor blood must be kept in cold storage, where it has a 28-day shelf life.
(Non-hemoglobin synthetic blood substitutes, known as fluorocarbons, have proved to be less effective oxygen carriers.)
But free hemoglobin can wreak havoc in the human body, causing hypertension, cardiac arrest, or even death.
Nationalism continues to produce powerful political “antibodies” to American and European meddling in other countries’ internal affairs.
Stop-and-go aid has left Haiti in an unmitigated downward spiral.
Development Aid in Five Easy Steps
The remaining annual financial gap is therefore about $26 billion.
The money is there.
The needs are urgent.
Development beyond 2015
Sadly, we know that most countries will not meet the objectives by 2015.
Development in Reverse
When contemporary economists think of economic dualism, they think first and foremost of the Nobel laureate Sir W. Arthur Lewis.
Indeed, for Lewis, the coexistence of the traditional alongside the modern is what makes development possible.
These gaps are problematic, but, as Lewis emphasized, they also constitute a potential engine for economic growth.
By contrast, most Asian countries continue to behave in typical Lewisian fashion.
For these countries, globalization is a mixed blessing.
We need to apply global experience, yet with customization for local circumstances.
The next few years will be critical.
At that time, power was concentrated in a small number of states.
The cataloging and naming of diseases is a condition of scientific research, as well as its product.
Finally, diagnostic classification provides politicians the language for building or dismantling health programs.
In my view, the classification of mental disorders, as a form of public policy making, poses exceptional challenges.
A primary challenge is posed by the nature of mental illness itself.
Public policy concerning the mentally ill should empower, not marginalize.
If so, how?
How will the associated conditions be classified?
What social values will be advanced?
Classifying disease should reflect the best collaborations between science and politics.
Tyranny is of course one of the oldest political stories.
These accounts should be frozen, despite the difficulty in doing so in a world rife with secret banking and nominee accounts that disguise true ownership.
The world community would agree that no individual should serve as the head of government (president, prime minister, or other equivalent position) for more than ``X'' years.
An international term limit, of course, could infringe the right of a real democracy to keep a popular leader for more than 20 years.
Give me a break.
Since the start of this decade, neither recession nor hurricanes nor sky-high oil prices have seemed to dent their appetites.
The current state of affairs is all the more depressing because global economic growth in the past four years has been the fastest since the early 1970’s.
Wallis Simpson, the controversial US-born Duchess of Windsor, once famously quipped, “You can never be too rich or too thin.”
Nairobi &#45;&#45; A month ago, Kenya fell prey to a sudden burst of post-electoral violence that has left over 1000 dead and hundreds of thousands displaced.
Parallel to the growth agenda, there is a specific role for bilateral and multilateral diplomacy to play in support of improved governance.
In fact, development itself generates a number of strains on societies that lie at the very roots of conflict.
But the relationship between growth and political stability is subtler and less linear than we like to believe.
Did Hezbollah Win?
It is easy to read the 1973 war only in retrospect.
Within 48 hours, Israel seemed on the verge of defeat on both fronts.
But Israel’s tanks did well enough in limiting Israeli casualties.
The contingency plan remained on the shelf because of the lack of casualties among Israeli civilians.
Even after three weeks, the total was less than in some one-man suicide bombings.
Indeed, nor would such an offensive have eradicated Hezbollah, because it is a political movement in arms, and not just an army or a band of gunmen.
Nasrallah’s power base is now a hostage of Hezbollah’s good behavior.
Did Humans Invent Modernity?
The idea is quite simple.
Future archaeologists would do well not to seek an explanation of this variation in terms of visible differences in our skeletal biology!
Our modernity is probably a part of their legacy as well.
Acemoglu breaks down the Republican narrative into three distinct questions.
The main impetus for the boom came from the entire machinery of “private label” securitization, which was just that: private.
These people did not cause the crisis.
Dignity or Decline?
That Japan’s dignity is now a central issue should surprise no one.
Tension between Japan and China – which claims the islands – immediately soared.
Hatoyama was naïve enough to declare publicly his intention of turning the East China Sea into a Chinese-led “Sea of Fraternity.”
The “rare-earth threat” is not confined to Japan, as China accounts for over 90% of the world’s production, roughly 120,000 tons.
China dominates the global market simply because it has fairly abundant rare-earth ores close to the surface.
Of course, China also has abundant cheap labor to process ore.
Neither individuals nor nations have identical interests, however.
We should take care, however, not to confuse the means and ends of policy.
The world has seen such a synthesis before.
Diplomacy’s Darkest Hours
And nothing has attenuated the tensions between Israel and both Syria and Lebanon.
If it were not for the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Israel and Egypt would never have reached a peace settlement.
The European Union – an empire built through diplomacy and consensus – emerged out of the ashes.
Official diplomacy begins where the battlefield ends.
Disarming the Middle East
Indeed, Arab states have both developed and used chemical and biological weapons – not against Israel, so far, but against others in the region.
Iraq used them against Iran, Egypt in its war in Yemen of the 1970’s, and Iraq against its own Kurds.
Dispersing the Terrorist Storm
WARSAW – On September 11, 2001 at three p.m., Warsaw time, I was talking on the telephone with Poland’s Consul General in New York.
That said, we are not doomed to succeed.
Even well-intentioned social policies can have unwelcome consequences.
In some parts of the world, radicalization of this sort did take place.
They welcome measured and respectful US, European, and wider support.
In Europe various homegrown “single issue” extremist groups need close monitoring.
All available historical and contemporary evidence suggests that they must.
What can be done to break this pattern?
A North Korea with nuclear bombs surely poses a common threat to all Asians.
Of course, human beings and nation states do often behave in similar ways.
A jagged line loosely joining Tokyo to Jakarta via Seoul, Taipei, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore was sufficient to sustain international cooperation.
But that cooperation was nothing like a lasting alliance.
This differs markedly from Europe's shared Greco-Roman-Christian civilization.
If that dominance continues through increasingly powerful networking technologies, the chances of Asia creating a distinct unity of its own are slim.
Asia cannot afford to unite against the West.
For that way lies permanent dependence on the West.
But shouldn't the EU have only a single representative?
For the first time in 150 years, the West (America and the European Union) was out-manufactured, out-produced, out-exported, out-traded, and out-invested by the rest of the world.
David Miles of the Bank of England predicts three more financial crises in the coming two decades.
Europe’s banking-sector liabilities are nearly five times higher than in the US, at 345% of GDP.
Germany’s banks are leveraged at 32 times their assets.
DNA: Oracle or Nemesis?
Of what use is genetic information about a disease when there are no therapeutic options?
Can we avoid the creation of a genetic underclass?
As we seek to control disease, can we afford to mandate controls over reproduction?
NIS, Serbia – The influence of diet on health has been known since the Ancient Greeks.
But what specifically makes fruits and vegetables so beneficial is not clear.
But will the benefits be the same?
Free radicals are produced continuously in all cells as part of their normal functioning.
Indeed, we still lack substantial information on how our bodies metabolize them and how they interact with one another.
As a result, it is still unclear whether dosage, duration of use, or parallel intake of other agents determine differences in their effect.
Results of ongoing clinical trials and further studies are required to improve our knowledge.
The United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England are particularly exposed.
It has happened before – for example, during the 1990’s financial crises.
There is also a fairness issue.
The financial sector has produced extraordinary profits, particularly in the Anglophone countries.
But this is not the typical pattern in any industry.
But there are holes in this case.
The inflation-indexed bond markets were not well developed in the 1980’s.
Each country draws up a list of what to be done, and each government is held accountable in terms of its performance.
In some emerging markets, telecom monopolies are stifling development of the Internet, and hence economic growth.
TAMPA – Patients and politicians increasingly demand a “cure” for cancer.
In 1854, the year Ehrlich was born, the diamondback moth was first observed in Illinois.
Within five decades, the moth had spread throughout North America.
It now infests the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
The reason arises from a component of tumor biology not ordinarily investigated: the cost of resistance to treatment.
Although resistant forms are commonly found in tumors that haven’t yet been exposed to treatment, they generally occur in small numbers.
Does Austerity Promote Economic Growth?
What then happened?
Mirac’lous Palaces, whose Walls,
Like those of Thebes, were rais’d by Play
Are to be let; . . . .
The building Trade is quite destroy’d
But their approach differed from that of previous researchers.
We have no alternative but to look at the historical evidence.
Policymakers cannot afford to wait decades for economists to figure out a definitive answer, which may never be found at all.
But, in my thinking and empirical research, this fashionable hypothesis cannot stand.
Capitalism does not per se threaten anyone’s welfare benefits.
The fashionable hypothesis denies even the most obvious benefit.
And, thanks to productivity growth, an ever larger share of jobs lay outside factories as well as farms.
Does Clinton Deserve Credit for US Prosperity?
In short, should Bill Clinton or Bill Gates get the credit for America’s boom?
America enjoys its longest continuous economic expansion in history, now more than nine years old.
Economic growth averaged 3.6% per year between 1992-1999, far above the 2.9% per year growth between1980-92.
No government, of course, could be fully responsible for such large trends.
Still, the Clinton Administration was more than a bystander.
It fashioned, bit by bit, a kind of “industrial policy” for the new Knowledge Economy.
His Administration therefore shaped a role for government that supports the generation and diffusion of knowledge in all spheres of knowledge creation.
To exorcise the demon, they are putting their economies through the wringer.
The credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor’s has just downgraded the sovereign-debt ratings of nine eurozone countries, including France.
First, governments, unlike private individuals, do not have to “repay” their debts.
The British government already must borrow £112 billion ($172 billion) more than it had planned when it announced its deficit-reduction plan in June 2010.
This may have disagreeable distributional consequences.
Does Egypt Need a Pharaoh?
That was a wise decision.
To elect a president is to commit to one person, generally for at least four years.
A parliamentary system, not a president-cum-pharaoh, looks like the best path for both countries.
There are countervailing forces.
The high-growth countries (China and India) are large and getting larger relative to the rest.
There are, of course, dissidents, and the balance could shift quickly.
It is the course we are on.
But for now, it is a journey without a clearly defined, widely accepted endpoint.
Britain, with around 1.6 million Muslims in a population of 58.7 million, provides an excellent place to test these notions.
There are four Muslims in the House of Lords and three in the House of Commons, more than for some other ethnic minorities.
But religion does not operate in a vacuum.
Its influence is mediated by many other factors.
Even in the self-confident Ottoman Empire, where Jews and Christians enjoyed considerable tolerance, followers of these religions were second-class citizens.
They welcome it because it gives them the freedom to retain their religious identity and to familiarize others with their beliefs.
Islam and Europe have long shaped one another's cultural identity.
Almost half have attempted suicide at least once.
Human trafficking rings tend to avoid Sweden, because business has gone sour.
It has now changed its legislation accordingly.
The success of the Swedish approach is not so surprising.
Most of these men showed pathological behavior towards women.
Prostitution is often dubbed “the oldest profession.”
Modern civil wars are horrific.
At $200 million per year, the risk falls further, to around 12.8%.
At $500 million, it goes down to 9%, and at $850 million drops to 7.3%.
Does the UN Still Matter?
The UN is more an instrument of its member states than an independent actor in world politics.
And when they cannot agree on a course of action, it is difficult for the organization to operate.
Another $7 billion supports UN peacekeeping forces in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Lebanon, Haiti, and the Balkans.
Even in the area of security, the UN retains an important role.
Since then, UN peacekeeping forces have been deployed more than 60 times.
There are now roughly 100,000 troops from various countries wearing UN blue helmets around the world.
Peacekeeping has had its ups and downs.
In other words, governments could no longer treat their citizens however they wanted.
In the DRC, peacekeeping forces have not been able to curb all violence, but they have helped to save lives.
While the UN system is far from perfect, the world would be a poorer and more disorderly place without it.
CAMBRIDGE &#45;&#45; Is the United States’ position as the world’s dominant superpower at risk if the dollar loses its super-currency status?
Former French president Valéry Giscard d’Estaing once famously complained about America’s “exorbitant privilege.”
In Rio de Janeiro in 1992, politicians from wealthy countries promised to cut emissions by 2000, but did no such thing.
We will make promises.
We will not keep them.
Instead, we must challenge the orthodoxy of Kyoto.
We can do better.
Doing Good Efficiently
COPENHAGEN – Policymakers can concoct many excuses not to invest in global aid and development projects.
The lowest place (see list) was given to dealing with climate change through cuts in CO2 emissions.
Even taking into account some of the key environmental damage from warming, we would lose money on the investment, with returns of just $685 billion.
Getting improved stoves to half the people affected would cost $2.3 billion.
Fortifying products with iron costs as little as $0.12 per person, per year.
RANKING WORLD INVESTMENTS
1. Micronutrient supplements for children (vitamin A and zinc)
3. Micronutrient fortification (iron and salt iodization)
5. Improving agricultural technology
11. Low-cost heart attack drugs for developing countries
12. Malaria prevention and treatment
13. Tuberculosis identification and treatment
16. Pumps and wells to improve water coverage in rural areas
24. Large, multipurpose dam in Africa to improve water coverage
29. A package of R&amp;D and mitigation to combat global warming
A recent case in point is the imbroglio in Andhra Pradesh in India, where the administration has moved to curb microfinance.
These are not trivial benefits.
The “asset” that is purchased need not be a physical asset.
So the authorities acted.
The US and China have engaged simultaneously in dispute and dialogue for several years – again reminiscent of what Japan went through with the US in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
But these are, or ought to be, problems that we can solve.
Corruption charges are flying between Prime Minister Zhu Ronghi, China's number three leader, and Li Peng, the country's second leading politician.
The Ming Emperor Cheng Zu's internal espionage agency (1403-1424) was known as the Dong Chang or "Eastern Workshop."
Staffed by eunuchs, it reported to the emperor directly.
After being victimized by Chiang Kai-shek's spies, China's Communist rulers created a vast spying apparatus of their own.
Like Saturn devouring his children, however, Chinese spying devours Central Committee members and dissidents alike.
Europe’s Anti-Europeans
And, on the Turkish side, there was a sense of superiority vis-à-vis the Arab world.
History is moving in the Middle East, but not in the direction that Turkey would prefer.
Don Quixote, Dissident
This is the unmistakable stamp of greatness in a writer.
For an East European like myself, it is not easy to ignore the history of the circus – or history itself.
In the socio-political arena, Augustus the Fool faces the Clown of Power.
Cervantes’ political parody can be read in many twentieth-century East European stories.
Its incomparable vitality and language, for example, find their way into the work of the Soviet writer Andrei Platonov.
Don\u0027t Bet on a Quick US Recovery
Whither the US economy?
(There have been changes in the way we correct for price changes, so that what we measure today as 4% actually represents what we used to measure as a substantially smaller number.)
Don’t Blame The Euro
This is good news.
But we could see some applications entering clinics in five years or so.
A stem cell can come from an embryo, fetus or adult.
It has two properties.
Under the right conditions it can reproduce itself and it can also give rise to the specialized cells that make up the tissues and organs of the body.
There have been stunning advances in getting these cells to change their destiny - transforming blood cells into nerve cells, for example.
No, a new way of thinking was required and Britain provided that with the Warnock Report of 1984.
Embryonic stem cells are derived from an early embryo called blastocysts at about the 5 th day.
Into this vacuum has stepped President Bush.
Their work - their dreams - will change all of our lives for the better. 
How we deal with these challenges is the greatest economic question of our time.
Yet, the way that it has been set up, it will inevitably fail.
Some would have us believe that getting China and India on board will be easy.
Yet, the total also would be seven times cheaper than the Kyoto Protocol, and many times cheaper than the Copenhagen Protocol is likely to be.
Don’t Feed the Dragon
But China is no ordinary trading partner.
All of these abuses are raised repeatedly at EU-China summits, to little or no avail.
In the Cold War era, there was a mechanism for such trade.
The economic impact of the current system already is severe.
Third, publicly financing health could increase overall employment.
Canada’s provinces phased in national health insurance from 1961 to 1975.
No one wants this.
The exit process has begun.
Not everyone is happy with this news.
Their strategy worked.
In an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, for example, Bundesbank president Axel Weber made it clear that future rate hikes were very much on the table.
The billions lent to Russia quickly wound up in the Swiss and Cyprus bank accounts of Russia's oligarchs.
Regrettably, the US Treasury immediately threw cold water on the proposals.
More balance is needed.
India - once a British colony, does not; France does.
An alternative is demanded.
The IMF has been trying to create an alternative.
But there is a critical difference between balancing and subservience.
LJUBLJANA - Throughout history, political leaders have supported existing communication technologies in order to defend the system in which they rule.
The media are a cornerstone of democracy.
Scarcity of parchment required all decision-making to be concentrated in a court consisting of a handful of people.
Print, paper, and newspapers enabled the rise of new types of political systems based on expanded popular participation.
Unfortunately for both, their main strengths – transmitting information and connecting people – happen to be what the Internet does best.
Blogs and social-networking platforms encourage seamless, cost-free association – the most efficient form of organization imaginable.
VIENNA – These days, a dollar won’t get you very far in a rich economy.
In Sierra-Leone alone, over 60% of the country’s youth are jobless.
It is ‘our’ problem too.
And last but not least. Development without access to energy won’t happen.
The Soviet Union possessed a great deal of soft power in the years after World War II.
What it needs is a political settlement, and that will be possible only with the withdrawal of America's occupying army.
For every dollar that it is giving to the Global Fund, the Bush Administration is committing $350 to Iraq.
Doomsday for the Dollar?
Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics calls this situation "a disaster in the making."
In the past six months, the current round of the US dollar cycle entered stage three.
Double-Dip Days
Growth is set to slow further, to 1.5% in the second half of this year and into 2011.
Whatever letter of the alphabet US economic performance ultimately resembles, what is coming will feel like a recession.
The potential sources of such a shock are legion.
Avoiding double dip recession will be difficult.
No surprise, then, that bosses who couldn't legitimately show the market strong profits cooked the books, often with the help of their supposedly independent accountants.
Two years ago "Save Social Security" (America's state pension system) was a political mantra.
After lording it over the world for so long, Americans should accept today's rebukes with grace.
Down with Debt Weight
Down With Human Rights
The relationship between the United Nations and the human-rights movement has always been ambiguous.
These include, as “first among equals,” the UN’s 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
It is generally agreed that the summit was largely a failure.
Annan himself conceded as much in the speech he gave at the opening of the 60th UN General Assembly.
All of this brings to mind one of the great Spanish director Luis Buñuel’s late films.
Dracula and the Class Struggle
Dream House No More?
Of course, billions of others around the world share the same dream.
He showed me his driver's license with a $100-dollar bill tucked beside it.
If you don't take bribes, how can you pay off the boss?
Recently, I visited a dacha village in one of Moscow's prettiest suburbs.
But the most eye-catching estate belonged to a modest officer from the tax services.
An unnecessary precaution.
No one checks buses nowadays.
But it was always the same.
Without the bribe, the bus would have been delayed for hours at each stop, days for the whole journey.
But the 80,000 Russian soldiers opposing the rebels do have ammunition warehouses, from which arms are stolen and sold.
Not only arms: some junior officers sell their own men into slavery.
So the so-called 'simple people' look at this phenomenon with understanding.
But if you pay a small bribe, you travel for 50 rubles.
The conductor stopped her, saying that ticketed passengers were not allowed on the train!
For a price you can get into any college, no matter your credentials.
You can drive drunk, speed, ignore red lights - provided Ben Franklin is there to be given to the police.
Alexander Menshikov, Peter the Great's minister, understood the impossibility of winning the fight against corruption.
Uprooting corruption may leave a state without subjects.
Dry China
ANSHUN, GUIZHOU PROVINCE, CHINA -- The Huangguoshu Waterfall in China’s southwestern Guizhou Province is a magnificent sight, when there is water.
The largest waterfall in Asia, it plunges over a sheer cliff more than 200 feet high in a thundering display of foam, mist, and rainbows.
Each evening, it gets turned off as if it were a garden fountain.
No one can say with any certainty what the causes are.
Let national governments take responsibility for their countries' economic performance.
Last year was a bad one for free trade.
Farming, fishing, and forestry now account for less that 2% of the total economy and less than 4% of the workforce.
Dying in Court
Then she will die.
Taylor does not want to go through all of that.
Last month, Smith issued her judgment.
He gave evidence at the trial.
Dying to Grow?
This brings us back to the conundrum of correlation versus causation.
The French study compared all patients who took growth hormone to the general population.
But the two groups are not at all comparable: kids who receive the drug are far from normal.
These kids are severely impaired.
Turner syndrome, a chromosomal abnormality in which all or part of one of the sex chromosomes is absent, manifests itself in several ways.
If you or a loved one has taken (or is taking) human growth hormone under a physician’s supervision, you shouldn’t lose sleep over it.
GENEVA – As the United Nations Conference on Disarmament begins a seven-week session in Geneva, its future is on the line.
The “CD,” as it is informally known, has long served as the world’s only multilateral forum for negotiating disarmament.
Yet today, all is not well at the CD.
Unfortunately, that agenda was never implemented.
As a result, the CD has failed to make any substantive progress for 15 years.
We simply must not let one lost decade turn into a second.
The CD’s future is in the hands of its member states.
So is the consensus rule.
The message was clear: no more business as usual.
The CD’s member states must recognize that the Conference’s future is at a critical juncture.
That schedule makes the CD’s current session crucial to its future.
Reaffirming the CD’s agenda offers the prospect of renewed negotiations on disarmament issues.
So who would have to take the lead in such a situation?
Only time will tell whether betting the house to save the garage was the right move.
Earth Hour teaches us that tackling global warming is easy.
If switching off the lights for one hour per year really were beneficial, why would we not do it for the other 8,759?
In fact, Earth Hour will cause emissions to increase.
Electricity has given humanity huge benefits.
The light that it powers has enabled us to have active, productive lives past sunset.
Even people in Sub-Saharan Africa have electricity equivalent to about three servants.
This is relevant not only for the world’s poor.
Earth is Enough
Their numbers show that each American uses 9.4 hectares of the globe, each European 4.7 hectares, and those in low-income countries just one hectare.
Unfortunately, there are only 13.4 billion hectares available.
So the WWF points out that we are already living beyond Earth’s means, using around 30% too much.
We are using up too much of the planet’s area.
But wait a minute. How can we do that?
How can we actually use more area than there is on earth?
Likewise, organic farming actually leaves a larger footprint than its conventional cousin.
It is not at all obvious to anybody how to convert CO2 to area.
The planet we have is more than enough.
There has even been talk of military action.
Prior sovereignty is unclear; there were fishermen from Japan in Takeshima/Dokdo, and some awareness of the Senkaku/Diaoyu in imperial China.
But no formal claims were made by any state.
Things became more complicated after World War II.
President Lee is a conservative, and relatively pro-Japanese.
As a result, the Japanese view his recent demands for apologies, money, and recognition of Korean sovereignty over the islands in the Sea of Japan as a kind of betrayal.
His political opponents are not the Japanese, but the Korean left.
East Timor’s Example
MANILA &#45;&#45; East Timor, now known as Timor-Leste, is the world’s newest democracy.
The Portuguese arrived not long after, and stayed 400 years.
While peaceful parliamentary elections were held on June 30, an atmosphere of apprehension has prevailed ever since.
Groups of angry marauding young men armed with stones and slingshots ran amok, setting up roadblocks and torching buildings.
Gusmão will now need to prove himself at the head of an inexperienced government.
Indeed, the Timorese people have consistently shown that what they want from their government is openness, dialogue, and majority voting under the rule of law.
That should stand as a warning to Timor Leste’s clashing factions, lest any of them conclude that repression and dictatorship are the best solution.
Eastern Europe’s Ostrich Policy on HIV
On a recent trip to these countries, and despite repeated requests, no politician or public-health official in either country would meet with me.
Many countries outside the region take a similar stance.
Humans are humans.
HIV-infected IDUs of course have sex with non-users.
For the first time, all proceedings were translated into Russian.
But no high-level Russian or Ukrainian official attended.
But the ECB is not going to cut rates even though, for public relations reasons of keeping the political wolves at bay, it deceptively hints it might.
Anyone who spends nine minutes watching the video presentation of the Arc will see that its potential is nothing short of breathtaking.
In the 1930’s, however, economic nationalism was not the only show in town.
Italian, Greek, or Portuguese public debt is so high that any attempt to use fiscal spending as part of a strategy to combat the economic crisis is doomed to fail.
France and Germany, by contrast, have an inherently strong fiscal position.
In any case, it only ever worked for the larger states.
Control of banking is the simplest.
Even so, while informal institutions can improve people’s lives, they can also be detrimental to development.
In these cases, women are often the victims.
LONDON – The king of Bhutan wants to make us all happier.
The British economy is contracting.
Greece’s economy has been shrinking for years.
The fewer people there are, the less risk we face of heating up the planet.
The groundwork for this question was laid some time ago.
Some Empirical Evidence.”
The mean average of their incomes is $25,000, but 90% earn $10,000.
That is not an idle example.
We live in a pushy society with turbo-charged fathers and “tiger” mothers, constantly goading themselves and their children to “get ahead.”
BEIJING – Throughout the just concluded 18th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party ubiquitous television screens in trains and metro stations broadcast a live feed of the Chinese assembly.
China is at a turning point.
Is this feasible?
The Limits to Panic
Instead, the resources generated by human ingenuity remain far ahead of human consumption.
Population growth has been slowing since the late 1960’s.
Food supply has not collapsed (1.5 billion hectares of arable land are being used, but another 2.7 billion hectares are in reserve).
Paper, for example, typically comes from sustainable forests, not rainforests.
When lifted out of poverty, most people can afford to avoid infectious diseases.
Today’s fashion in development is no different.
Moreover, generating economic growth requires hitting the right targets, not doing everything at once.
These problems all require different methods for unlocking growth.
Conventional wisdom may finally be catching up with him.
When the Euro was introduced in January 1999, it traded at $1.17.
That reversal is now underway.
But such changes occur less frequently than is often supposed or alleged.
They do not trade on fundamental information, but on the latest gossip and fads.
Economist Robert Schiller of Yale explained very clearly and at book length why US equity prices would fall.
Economics for Parrots
Which do we see now?
The question that will be a mystery to them is why so many economists of our day did not know how to say: “supply and demand, supply and demand.”
Economics in Crisis
Yet that is not what economics departments are saying nowadays.
George Soros has put generous funding behind the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET). The Bank of England has also tried to stimulate fresh ideas.
So all is well.
Yet their protagonists see no problems to address.
Why has the rate of growth undergone an acceleration that is extraordinarily rapid over so short a period?
Where is the economics of invention, innovation, adaptation, and diffusion?
Not in Marshall.
What were the small differences that turned out to matter so much?
Consider all that is required. Modern markets need an infrastructure of transport, logistics, and communication, much of it the result of public investments.
The unavoidable reality of our global economy is that the principal locus of legitimate democratic accountability still resides within the nation state.
Even so, we say that John died from cancer, not that he died from a policy decision to stop payment for cancer screening.
We say that Mary died in a car accident, not that she was a casualty of the Road Traffic Act.
What about young and healthy citizens?
After all, saving statistical lives does save individuals.
It is clearly marked, but nobody helps you get to it.
That is about 4% of Japanese GDP in 2010.
Insurance companies operating in Japan repaid some of the losses.
So, with lower growth expectations, the trills would likely have a much lower price now.
Edmund Phelps’s Journey
But Phelps chose Yale, where he came into direct contact with James Tobin and Thomas Schelling.
Stints at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University followed.
By this point, Phelps had already acquired an international reputation through his work on the golden rule of capital accumulation (he was 28).
Educating Americans about Muslim Voices
From June 5-14, New Yorkers are experiencing the rich diversity of Muslim cultures through a city-wide initiative, entitled “Muslim Voices: Arts and Ideas.”
More than 300 artists, writers, performers, and scholars from more than 25 countries, including the US, are gathering for this unprecedented festival and conference.
The Lost Generations
Yet rich countries also fail.
A remarkable new documentary film, The House I Live In, shows that America’s story is even sadder and crueler than that, owing to disastrous policies.
Many politicians are eager accomplices to this lunacy.
Social investments are large, financed by high taxes, which rich people actually pay, rather than evade.
Children born poor are likely to remain poor; children born into affluence are likely to be affluent adults.
The G-20 was the great winner of the financial crisis.
It is in the nature of complex data-gathering programs that no one really has an overview.
The revelations thus encourage wild conspiracy theories.
The Kremlin’s handling of the affair is indicative of the tense state of US-Russia relations.
With few notable exceptions, such as US Ambassador to Brazil Tom Shannon, US diplomacy has lacked a strategic vision for Latin America.
BERLIN – Egypt lies at the heart of the Arab revolution, even if the original spark occurred in Tunisia.
This implies that the overthrow of Egypt’s democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, will have much broader repercussions.
No one should deny that what happened in Egypt was a military coup, or that forces from former President Hosni Mubarak’s regime have returned to power.
So what options does Egypt now have?
Will the country return to military dictatorship?
All three alternatives are possible, though it is impossible to predict which one will come to pass.
But we should not be deceived.
When the revolutions of 1848 in Europe were rolled back the following year, everything was nonetheless different, as we now know.
Egypt Holds Its Breath
CAIRO – “You are the authority, above any other authority.
Egypt Needs a President, Not a Pharaoh
Such demands are not new.
What makes the demands for reform more pressing this time are ominous developments in Egypt, the region, and in the wider world.
A few weeks ago, several youngsters suffocated to death while being deported back to Egypt across the Libyan desert in overloaded trucks.
The current constitution was adopted in October 1971, and has 211 articles, 30 of which concern the presidency.
Egypt on Jordan’s Mind
Constitutional changes were adopted.
An independent election commission was created by law.
Like other Arab countries, Jordan, with seven million people, looks up to Egypt, its most populous and powerful Arab neighbor.
In 2004, a major reform program was launched under former Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif.
Major Israeli cities were hit several times.
During Operation Cast Lead, rockets struck perilously close to Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion Airport.
For Israeli leaders, it was only a matter of time before Tel Aviv could and would be hit.
The Emir of Qatar paid a visit to Gaza as a reward for Hamas’s break with Iran and left a check.
But Hamas is not alone in Gaza.
It responded with massive shelling of southern Israel, and managed to send several missiles toward Tel Aviv and one toward Jerusalem.
So Morsi is juggling.
But, so far, he has not crossed a single red line.
The Ministry of Interior (MOI) is not the only place that should be cleansed.
The judiciary needs that” as well.
Egypt’s revolution continues.
Egypt’s New Old Government
The situation in the ministry is unsustainable.”
Likewise, higher education went to Mostafa Mossad, an FJP member who was in charge of the education portfolio during Morsi’s campaign.
The struggle for Egypt thus continues.
Last August, he culled the leaders of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF).
If Morsi does not remain in power, much will depend on how he is removed.
Predictions are used to test only the tiny minority of explanations that survive these criteria.
It was just that the problem that the term was intended to solve no longer existed.
El Salvador’s Democratic Test
The stakes are high.
In the past, the law has been used to curb parties of both the extreme left and the extreme right.
This has clearly contributed to preventing any sign of a possible return to the totalitarian ways of the twentieth century.
This is where rules that impose term limits on officeholders, such as the Twenty-Second Amendment of the United States Constitution, have their place.
It cannot be said too often that democracy and the rule of law are not the same thing.
The rule of secular law is the most delicate prerequisite of a liberal order.
The opposition comprises most of Venezuela's organized civil society, not only business, but also trade unions, professional associations, and NGOs.
But while harassing the opposition, he has not overturned the minimal principles of democracy.
Indeed, he now invokes his formal democratic legitimacy to fend off demands for his resignation.
An election now in Venezuela will save, not undermine, democracy.
Elections Without Winners
There are other recent examples, including, perhaps most notoriously, the 2000 presidential election in the United States.
How should we best deal with them?
Often, they want change – just that.
But the real issue is not so simple.
This is what has happened in Italy, and it may well occur in the Czech Republic.
There is currently no such risk in Europe.
Electric Cars and Sustainable Development
One hundred years later, competition is again stirring.
The age of electric vehicles is upon us.
The Toyota Prius, a hybrid-electric vehicle first introduced in Japan in 1997, marked an initial breakthrough.
These different vehicles will be able to tap into countless energy sources.
Second, the storage capacity of the vehicle fleet will play an important role in stabilizing the power grid.
Millions of women suffer in this way, but their stories remain untold.
Likewise, in the United Kingdom, 473,000 sexual offenses are reported annually, 60,000-95,000 of which are classified as rape.
The Political Importance of Elizabeth Warren
The problems that brought us the terrible crisis of 2007-08 have not been fixed.
In the US, there will be no new legislation under the current Congress – and probably not for a long while to come.
And, in fact, they have only gotten bigger in the past four years.”
Other tropical parasitic diseases imply similarly extraordinary burdens in Africa.
Similarly, engineers have developed ways to capture the carbon dioxide that results from burning coal in power plants and store it safely underground.
Consider also the depletion of ocean fisheries through over-fishing.
Politics will still play its role.
Embracing the Empire
One should always be careful about attributing motives to other people’s views.
But the term “Islamofascism” was not coined for nothing.
Saddam Hussein, who was hardly an Islamist, and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is, are often described as natural successors to Adolf Hitler.
We are not living a replay of 1938.
Why the easy equation of Islamism with Nazism?
Israel is often mentioned as a reason.
To certain evangelical Christians, it is the holy site of the Second Coming of the Messiah.
But the commitments by the G8 and other key partners – such as the Nordic states and the Netherlands – also have played a critical role.
Liberia was Africa’s basket case.
Today, the war is over.
Debt relief is at the heart of the support we need.
Emerging Infectious Diseases
Today’s bio-diversity crisis is not just one of lost habitats and extinct species.
There is every reason to take these events seriously, because EID’s appear to have a long evolutionary history.
Pathogens also have specialized means of transmission from host to host.
But climate change alters everything.
But some of the ticks are closely related to known carriers, and thus are potential carriers themselves.
Simply put, we must complete the global inventory of species. Now.
Pathogens have highly specialized transmission modes, and groups of closely related species tend to be very similar.
All species of malaria, for example, are transmitted by mosquitos.
Rather, they are a common outcome of geographic dispersal associated with large-scale environmental changes.
Emerging Lessons from the Crisis
ITHACA, NY – The US financial system is careening on the edge of a meltdown.
Where will it end?
It is impractical to devise a regulatory framework that accounts for every specific financial instrument and institution.
Austrian, Italian, and Swiss regulators, seeing that their banks’ assets and liabilities were in their own currencies, looked the other way.
But recent experience suggests that quickest is not best.
Emma Bonino and The War For Europe\u0027s Future
Rome was not built in a day and it will take many such assaults to reform it!
End Taiwan’s Isolation
Taiwan is, de facto, an unrecognized independent state with a vigorous democracy and high standards of human rights.
End the Silence Over Chechnya
According to estimates by non-governmental organizations, the figure is between 100,000 (that is, one civilian out of ten) and 300,000 (one out of four).
How many voters participated in the November 2005 elections?
But censorship cannot completely hide the horror.
Under the world’s very eyes, a capital – Grozny, with 400,000 inhabitants – has been razed for the first time since Hitler’s 1944 punishment of Warsaw.
What would be said if the British government had bombed Belfast, or if the Spanish government bombed Bilbao, on the pretext of quelling the IRA or the ETA?
Are they still considered human?
Must the world accept the rape of girls who were kidnapped by the occupying forces or their militias?
Following NATO’s intervention, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1244, placing Kosovo under UN administration.
Sadly, Belgrade’s vision of Kosovo returning to Serbian rule – albeit with autonomy – ignores these realities.
Relations between Kosovo’s Albanian majority and Serb minority remain uneasy.
European security is hinged on Serbian integration, just as Serbian aspirations hinge on the EU.
Girls under 15 are five times more likely than women in their twenties to die during pregnancy and childbirth.
But this bias against educating girls starts even earlier.
All this has a damaging inter-generational impact.
The challenge is to help communities accelerate change.
Laws have little impact.
But this has not translated into change on the ground.
This return to pre-feminist discourse is not confined to India.
Instead, women who go to the police are urged not to file a complaint.
Movies, religion, music, and women themselves are all blamed for male sexual violence against women, but rapists are not held responsible.
States are obliged to report on implementation of the Bucharest Declaration in 2015.
Ending International Occupation
Let there be no mistake: the OSCE played a positive role in stabilizing Albania.
Its democracy is secure; its economy improving.
Albanian problems now demand homemade Albanian compromises.
Is it the OSCE's presence, and not Albania's government, that is now keeping the country what it has long been, a hermit kingdom?
But saying that a body means well and saying that it is actually doing any good are two different things.
Of course, an effective OSCE mission, confined to Tirana and comprised of experts that the country still needs, would be useful.
But Albania no longer needs the OSCE's staff to be scattered throughout the country to monitor every aspect of its political life.
It is time for it to take a bow and go home to Vienna.
CAPE TOWN – Eliminating nuclear weapons is the democratic wish of the world’s people.
The unspeakable human suffering that they inflict is the same whatever flag they may bear.
Just as unsettling is the Pentagon’s push for the development of nuclear-armed drones – H-bombs deliverable by remote control.
Such a treaty is feasible and must be urgently pursued.
That war must be won.
Chechnya should remain part of the Russian Federation.
But this method is not working and won't work if pursued along the current lines.
Even Georgia now closely - although not as closely as Russia would like - restricts Chechen activity.
This happened after the first Chechen campaign (1994-1996), but the peace that ensued was merely an armed truce.
The short answer is no.
Combined, the legislation appears on track to run 30,000 pages.
But the papers were published anyway, and the ideas were implemented.
It is not necessary to recount the consequences.
A simpler and more transparent system would ultimately lead to more lending and greater stability, not less.
It is high time to restore sanity to financial-market regulation.
Not one has a Muslim majority.
Muslims cannot blame the United States for their lack of democracy.
Continuing this policy is not in America's interest.
As long as the Middle East remains a place where freedom does not flourish, it will remain a place of stagnation, resentment, and violence ready for export."
But, like medical doctors' Hippocratic oath, America and others must pledge to do no harm in promoting democracy.
Unrestrained zeal to make the world better could make it worse.
Moreover, mere elections should never be confused with democracy.
Rather, what distinguishes democracy from other systems is a distribution of power both within government and within society.
The utility of the state is clear.
The state is also the final arbiter of law.
The origin of the nation-state idea is unclear.
About 15 years ago, I spent a summer in France’s Loire Valley.
As many travelers to France will attest, people in the French countryside believe that they, not Parisians, constitute the “true” France.
This division of core and periphery is common in many countries.
China is often thought to be governed by the Han majority.
But this group is linguistically, culturally, and even genetically diverse.
As the author Ian Buruma recently mused, it is not clear what people mean by “China.”
It is difficult to imagine a nation that is confined to one state or a state that contains one nation.
A recent credit card commercial depicts a father and son traveling to Norway to trace their family’s origins.
Just across another sea, perhaps.
Some kind of drug consumption has existed throughout history in the most diverse cultures.
There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the harm it causes is at worst similar to the harm caused by alcohol or tobacco.
Russia’s trade with the EU between January and August 2007 reached $173.3 billion, or 51.6% of its foreign trade turnover.
EU countries will continue to demand energy, and Siberian deposits are far from exhausted.
Such statements are encouraging.
Russia also has to become integrated into the international economic system, accepting the rules applied by the rest of the world.
The return of internally displaced persons and due care for them must be a core component of any such arrangement.
This is a golden opportunity for the remaining eight countries to endorse the CTBT, enabling it to come into legal effect.
This era was ended in 1996, when the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.
This would be analogous to the role the Commission plays in promoting the Trans European Networks for road and rail communications.
For example, the Baltic states need links to the Finnish and Polish grids to end their energy isolation.
What happened?
At the same time, America’s bargaining position in world politics should be enhanced.
Energy Markets or Energy Governance?
That will be complicated, of course.
A radioactive leak, the rupture of an undersea oil well and, above all, CO2 emissions do not threaten just one country.
Few countries have a neutral energy balance.
The Middle East has a 266% commercial surplus of oil, and the US a 65% deficit.
The solution must include a new institution.
Engaging the Islamists
The West needs to establish clear and consistent rules of engagement.
This problem is rather technical in nature, as are its solutions.
The group calls their version of contingent capital “regulatory hybrid securities.”
The FSB was created in April 2009 at the G-20’s London summit as the successor to the Financial Stability Forum.
Since the 1980’s, “shareholder value” has increasingly become the focus of corporate governance.
Some have even lost their jobs.
But their arguments are flawed and misleading.
Enlightenment on Trial
WARSAW &#45;&#45; Ever since democracy appeared in ancient Athens, it has generated suspicion among those who believe that humanity’s highest purpose is virtue, not freedom.
But this is really only part of the story.
Subconsciously, citizens expect their leaders to display the ancient leadership virtues of disinterestedness, courage, and devotion to service.
For Pakistan, the irony is that the country has been a success story for polio eradication, with the number of cases falling from 197 in 2011 to 58 in 2012.
Erdoğan is right, but it is he who must pass the test.
A dramatic book that was published just before the referendum on the constitution sheds light on who is behind these machinations.
Indeed, annual real GDP rose by 9% in 2010.
ISTANBUL – Turkey’s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has taken on a daunting challenge.
Escape from Moscow
Estonia’s experience suggests how Georgia and Moldova should shape their policies vis-à-vis Russia.
But Estonia kept its nerve.
When Georgia gained independence in 1991, it did not receive the same sort of help from Western Europe.
The economy grew by 8% in 2005 and more than 10% in 2006.
It is said to be lawless and corrupt.
Only Russia can solve the problem.
Michael Woodford, one of the world's leading authorities on central banking, offers a strategy to break the grip of falling prices.
It is already inexpensive, but it is a solid rather than a liquid, a major pollutant, and a source of greenhouse gas emissions.
To be successful, a strategy of fighting climate change must be not only fair, but also effective.
Advanced countries by themselves simply cannot ensure that safe global CO2  levels are reached.
CAMBRIDGE – Libyans have a new lease on life, a feeling that, at long last, they are the masters of their own fate.
Indeed, from West Africa to Mongolia, countries are experiencing windfalls from new discoveries of oil and mineral wealth.
In the extreme case, this competition can take the form of civil war.
But some countries have succeeded, and their strategies could be useful models for Libya, Iraq, Ghana, Mongolia, and others to emulate.
Leaders have free will.
Poor people are locked into a low-level asset (or capability) trap.
The high level of income inequality requires specific poverty reduction efforts.
Eternal Debts
"Everything . . . everything changes."
So goes the refrain in a famous Argentine song.
Our indigenous communities continue to lose their land to foreign corporations.
Endemic diseases and illiteracy are increasing.
Eternal Hong Kong
I have been a part of Hong Kong’s civil service for more than three decades.
In short, ours is a system of government like many others.
Within the ranks of our civil service and judiciary are nationals from Britain, Australia, the United States, Canada, and India.
We have a large foreign population and one of the world’s largest consular corps.
Good government is not a competition.
It is thus crucial to the good governance of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region.
Ethiopia’s New Climate of Fear
Ethiopia’s journalists are not entirely innocent.
But Ethiopia’s people deserve more from their government.
Ethiopia’s Struggle for Democracy
After all, Ethiopia has never known democracy.
The government did make some media available and engaged in more than 10 live televised debates.
What was surprising was the magnitude of the victory.
My fear is that the will of Ethiopia’s people will be stifled by government hard-liners.
Our people have played their part with courage and discipline.
Ethnic Cleansing in the Caribbean
SANTO DOMINGO – I am a native-born citizen of the Dominican Republic.
This is the only place I have ever called home.
Yet, after more than 45 years in this country, my nationality –along with that of thousands of other Dominicans – is being called into question.
Like many Dominicans, I am of Haitian ancestry.
My family came to the Dominican Republic from neighboring Haiti to find work.
Their journey was not uncommon, nor was it discouraged.
This no one questioned.
This no one doubted.
Some people are even singled out based solely on their appearance.
Perhaps it will stop when the international community starts speaking out against the Dominican Republic’s discriminatory policies.
How would the new fiscal rules be designed?
So the rules would have to be set with reference to each member state’s cyclically adjusted fiscal position (for which the OECD already produces estimates).
If a country deviated from its fiscal targets, it would be barred from borrowing additional funds at the risk-free interest rate.
SANTIAGO – The day of the Eurobond may be near.
It will not save Spain and Italy, either.
And it would spare German and other taxpayers from the EU’s solvent northern countries from having to fund yet another bailout of a southern member state.
If too loose, a rule is merely ornamental.
Of course, I do not fear some sort of military clash between Turkey and the EU.
The key problem is the distribution of savings within the eurozone.
Good question.
Europe Agonistes
This war, unlike the previous 1982 war in Lebanon, is for Americans not a war of choice but of necessity.
At a time of reconciliation between Christianity and Judaism, a less Christian Europe has been more reluctant to consider the spiritual specificity of Israel.
After all, Jews are destined to be converted to Christianity before the end time.
Europeans, with some nuances, are now emotionally united in their “coolness” toward Israel.
Nonetheless, political divisions within Europe are reminiscent of those that prevailed at the time of the Iraq war.
The Coming Atlantic Century
John McCain, the US senator and 2008 presidential candidate, always leads a large congressional delegation to Munich.
This year, Vice President Joe Biden did the honors, bumping the US representation up a notch.
Pascual projected that the US will be able to import all of its energy needs from within the Americas by 2030.
That honor would likely fall to China, which would become increasingly dependent on the Middle East.
In a nutshell, if gas is exported in liquid form, it is fungible.
Jorma Ollila, Chairman of Royal Dutch Shell, described the global map of major shale oil and gas deposits.
All of this data got Brazilian Foreign Minister Antonio de Aguiar Patriota’s attention.
Imagine that community spreading down the east coast of Latin America and the west coast of Africa.
It might be an Atlantic century after all.
In order to do so, the People’s Republic needs much more sophisticated arms than those it possesses today.
Over 600 missiles, already deployed on the mainland, are aimed at cities and military bases on the island.
To the Germans, the Chinese probably murmur something about Siemens and Volkswagen.
To the Dutch their whispers are most likely about Philips.
This silence gives a hideous signal.
Street demonstrations (or, as the French say: Amanif”) are a traditional part of the political vocabulary in France, and these seem to be evolving along customary lines.
Recent events in Germany, by contrast, are less traditional and more worrying.
Yet the government is obviously worried by the upsurge of xenophobia and neo-Nazi violence.
It is that commitment by which the government is now bound.
Europe and President Bush
On the European side is the temptation to speed the emergence of the Union as an international actor by constantly claiming autonomy or independence from the US.
My response is that it is about both, and that Washington should support both.
A similar logic of partnership applies to enlargement.
A case in point is the issue of National Missile Defense.
The EU is rightly searching for its identity as a collective actor.
The Birth of Fiscal Unions
For this reason, Europeans have often looked toward the model of the United States.
Germans refer to this solution as a Schuldenbremse (debt brake).
Europe and the Euro
As the slogan goes: euro in your wallet, Europe in your pocket.
But Cyprus, Malta, and Slovakia have since followed suit in making the euro their currency.
Our common currency should rather be viewed as an inspiring symbol – the symbol of a Europe that is vibrant, attractive, and, above all, cohesive.
The euro, like the EU itself, is an exciting adventure that must continue – and we intend to make sure that it does.
So it is right that the EU Council of Ministers is meeting to grapple with this challenge.
The Russia-Georgia war showed just how much this region matters to the wider world.
Ukraine is another matter.
Europe as a Task
For me as Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Europe has a meaning that goes far beyond geography.
Nowadays, indeed, instead of deepening disparities in standards of living in Europe, which was the historic norm, differences are actually blurring as the quality of life everywhere in Europe rises.
Indeed, it is vital to understand that Europe's integration process is not mechanical but organic.
For no one should be mistaken: there are alternatives to European integration - all of them bad, unwanted, and dangerous.
Voluntary self-restraint, a voluntary sharing of our own rights and privileges with a wider collective, is paramount here.
Europe by Degrees
But, as Robert Schuman wrote in his Declaration in 1950, Europe could not be built all at once.
But not equally necessary is the enduring uncertainty about the common political platform upon which Europe’s voice in foreign policy will have to rely.
In whatever area, a group of more deeply integrated member states would give the Union a noyau dur (a hard core) , which might be very helpful in strengthening the EU as a whole.
The so-called “European Neighborhood Policy” has, so far, been a curious thing.
The war did not bring forth a real decision.
We will see.
Europe in the Back Seat
Global Trade Alert, an independent monitor, has identified more than 300 new protectionist measures introduced by G-20 members.
The large number of EU countries in the G-20 serves little purpose in the absence of systematic coordination of member states and Commission positions.
This must change.
But when it comes to recognizing that reality in the world’s international financial institutions, they adopt a different tune.
The two largest, Germany and France, have a constituency all their own.
However, these four constituencies also contain more than 20 other countries, most of which are not even EU members.
Together with the Scandinavian and British constituencies, there are thus eight EU representatives on the IMF’s executive board.
But this has changed with the creation of a European rescue fund in the form of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
The new orientation is irrevocable.
We have the great resources of Siberia.
We have hydroelectric power plants.
All of this needs to be done fast, by September 18 th .
Europe is Not the United States
First, the US is effectively a single labor market, with workers moving from areas of high and rising unemployment to places where jobs are more plentiful.
Europe is Winning on Productivity
When it comes to performance, Europe is king, not the US.
So, too, did Italy.
How should we interpret these facts?
US growth thus involves lots of job creation; Europe's growth, if high, keeps unemployment barely constant.
Europe is Working Longer
Siemens was the forerunner, going from 35 to 40 hours per week.
Germany primarily reacted to low-wage competition from ex-communist countries.
According to this view, there are no economic advantages of such a policy, because the total amount of labor in the economy is fixed.
But, again, capital would also work longer.
Europe Means Fair Play
Many Europeans see themselves as champions of global fair play.
Does it plan to swallow Ukraine, Belarus, and the Caucasus?
A sense of fair play also matters within the Union.
On the contrary, fair play requires American power to back it up.
That is not what happened, because the euro had other deficiencies of which its architects were unaware.
That was the root cause of today’s euro crisis.
Finally, the European Commission should receive a seat.
The celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome this month come at an opportune moment.
These thinkers – often imprecisely called “Federalists” – refer to the Constitution as a necessary step towards a European federation.
Related to this is the idea that only a strong EU can save the “European social model.”
Central banks are the classic example.
But PR won’t work unless there is a vision that ultimately sells itself.
Europe on Holiday
• the level of participation in the labor force;
So there may be something in this "cultural" explanation.
But why did this start around 1973?
Europeans tend to prefer vacations over growth.
Personally, I love taking more and more vacations.
Europe’s 4% Solution
In Greece, large fiscal deficits accompanied and exacerbated this trend.
In Spain, the counterpart to the current-account deficit was private-sector borrowing.
Such an approach should not be a goal in itself, but it might be a necessary evil to avert the danger of a euro implosion.
Yet it has become a reality of daily life for almost 320 million people in 15 European countries.
The years 1992-1993 witnessed a dramatic crisis in the European Exchange Rate System.
But it was never intended to do that.
Following the 2004 elections, the European People’s Party (EPP), which regroups right and center right parties, held 288 MPs of the Parliament’s 785 seats.
That opens the way to the possible return for a second term of José Manuel Barroso as president of the Commission.
One should have expected the right-wing to be punished in countries where they govern.
Extreme parties also benefited from the elections, as well as some “eurosceptic” parties.
Indeed, the far-right British National Party won its first ever seat.
Europe performs little better than the rest of the world.
In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, they are already the leading killer.
Genetic influences, along with nutritional, environmental, and poverty-related factors, play key roles.
Interstitial lung diseases vary considerably in incidence and prevalence.
As the incidence of lung disease rises, so will its costs.
Inpatient care is just the tip of the iceberg, amounting to €17.8 billion annually.
Europe’s Blame Game
Deregulation also leads to economies of scale, lowering prices even further, as we all know when shopping at the hypermarket rather than the corner grocery store.
Rents disappear, and think of the effects of airline deregulation on pilots’ salaries.
This exonerating hypothesis does not hold water.
Europe’s Central Bank at Sea
NEWPORT BEACH – Central bank purists are confused.
How can the European Central Bank, a Germanic institution, now be in the business of buying government bonds issued by five of its 17 members?
A sea-faring analogy simplifies some of the complexity.
As the rescue is taking place, the vessel finds that it must also rescue two other, larger boats.
It does so, but not before the captain receives assurances that a larger ship is coming to assist.
The overwhelming hope is that the larger ship will come and save the day.
The fear is that it may not.
In a nutshell, this is the ECB’s situation today.
Without these other agencies’ help, the ECB’s unprecedented actions will end up being a bridge to nowhere.
Moreover, implementation will likely prove far from automatic, thereby testing the resolve of governments and institutions.
Some of the countries that achieved the highest growth in labor productivity also lost the most competitiveness (e.g. Ireland).
How is this possible?
Europe’s Competitiveness Shell Game
But that is precisely what happens when governments believe that economic salvation lies in winning a growing share of export markets.
It doesn’t.
Some countries – Scandinavia and the Netherlands, for example – do well.
Nor did I did introduce the issue of homosexuality into the debate over my appointment.
This means that anyone holding to the moral doctrines of most Christian churches should nowadays be considered a second-class citizen in the European Union.
But the European Commission is not accountable to the European Parliament in the same way that a national government is accountable to its parliament.
This document arose despite the fact that the Convention's mandate did not empower the delegates to produce a constitution.
This confuses even trained foreign diplomats who negotiate with Europe.
How can a European citizen really identify with Europe if no single "Europe" exists?
Europe's indistinct legal identity has another deleterious impact.
But if the Union encroaches on your rights, access to a court may be closed because the Union happens to have no legal personality!
Criticizing institutions is as essential a part of democracy as protecting enumerated legal rights.
In national life, acts of parliaments are called "statutes" or "laws," and these usually have names that you can rally for and against.
Would things be the same if the bill were called "Regulation 75"?
We need a single legislative council, a bicameral European Parliament, with one house representing member states, and the other the European electorate.
Of course, roadblocks await.
It is not the issues most often in the news – Iran or Afghanistan.
It is Europe’s contested neighborhood – the future of those countries between the eastern border of NATO and the European Union and the western border of Russia.
But none of the underlying tensions are resolved.
There is no stable solution in sight for Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
Instability and separatism are growing in the northern Caucasus, making the broader region more volatile.
But what about those countries in between – countries like Ukraine and Georgia and the southern Caucasus?
And what is Western policy?
It is time for the West to openly debate what its strategy is – and what it is not.
The European Oasis
It is an oasis of peace, if not dynamism.
CHISINAU – Three floors of Moldova’s parliament building are a charred ruin.
So is democracy in Moldova, a former Soviet republic that is now Europe’s poorest country.
A violent few broke into the offices of the country’s president and its parliament building, which was set on fire.
Stability is also important because the country borders on Romania, a European Union member state.
Together with the EU, the US can help ensure a credible investigation of the post-election violence and complaints against the police.
Add to this a plethora of regional dialects, which in Italy alone amount to around 20 (with several variants each).
In many secessionist regions, like Catalonia in Spain, they are de facto the official idiom.
A language is not just a systematic means of communicating.
It is a sign of identity, culture, and national pride.
The same concept expressed with different words in different languages generates different emotions.
Citizens’ passion, rather than technocrats’ creativity, should inspire political unification.
But they were wrong.
Europe, as Denis de Rougemont put it in 1946, is “la patrie de la memoire,” a tormenting and tormented memory, one must admit.
It can also teach many lessons.
In both, Europe is lacking.
America's irritation with some of its European allies - Tony Blair's UK being the noticeable exception - is understandable.
At the time of the Gulf War of 1991, US defense spending was 4.8% of GDP; it was far higher in the 1950s and 1960s.
Defense spending is 1.6% of GDP in Germany, 2% in Italy, and 1.5% in Spain; only France and the UK reach 3%.
Not in Europe.
PARIS – The European Union is now the proud owner of a Nobel Peace Prize.
The United Kingdom and Sweden argue that they cannot be made subservient to a central bank of which they are, at best, semi-detached members.
Non-Europeans, in particular, may find the entire topic impenetrably abstruse.
It is difficult to be optimistic about the success of an initiative built on such flimsy legal foundations, and lacking democratic legitimacy.
Europe’s Distant Mirror?
China at the beginning of the twenty-first century is not Bismarck’s newly unified Germany in the second half of the nineteenth century.
So why should they take unnecessary risks?
It was after visiting Singapore that Deng introduced “special economic zones” in southern China.
Twenty years ago, one of the main obstacles to creating an Asian Union was Japan – Asia’s most advanced and successful country, but one that did not feel Asian.
The rule of law is the equivalent for Asia today of what democracy was for Europe yesterday.
Without its gradual imposition, an Asian Union could at best remain only a pale and hollow copy of its European model.
That choice, of course, is not Slovenia’s alone and is, anyway, now hostage to other concerns.
Today, as almost anyone east of the old Iron Curtain will tell you, however, enlargement is moving ahead at a snail’s pace.
Soon after the Amsterdam summit of 1997, however, "minimalism" became insufficient.
The differences created among members may devastate the spirit of commonality.
That vagueness will be deliberate, because anyone speaking too bluntly on matters like this nowadays can expect to be quarantined like Jörg Haider.
But there have been more recent occurrences of nasty currency wars.
This is not American unilateralism, because it means working with Asia.
But a moment's reflection should remind us that Europe's problems are not amenable to currency manipulation.
The seat of the College of Europe in Natolin, near Warsaw, is a near perfect barometer to test the morale of Europe.
Students from “Old Europe” were energized by the idealism and confidence emanating from their Polish, Czech, Estonian, and other compatriots.
On May 1, 2004, I celebrated EU enlargement with my students.
We embraced each other under the blue flag with its 12 yellow stars.
They are, above all, gaining time.
The Union’s founding story is not their story, but the story of their parents or grandparents.
But how, exactly, should the balanced budget requirement be defined?
The EU’s fiscal compact, whatever its final form, will be little more than a sideshow.
Europe’s English-Speaking Peoples
Since its inception, the EU has made each member state’s language one of its official tongues.
Treating all EU languages on the same footing is a direct consequence of the formal equality of member states under the founding treaties.
The more languages, it seems, the more English.
When EU officials meet together or draft internal documents, they use only the “working languages”: French and, more often, English.
German, the EU’s most widely spoken native language, hardly makes a dent.
Representatives may demand interpretation into their home language, but a proposal to limit each country’s translation budget is likely to be accepted soon.
Indeed, nine out of ten schoolchildren in the EU now learn English.
The process resembles the selection of a standard in, say, consumer electronics.
People tend to opt for the standard (VHS, Windows, DVD) that they believe will come out on top, and thus contribute to that victory.
They have a centuries-old printed literature, and, above all, they are closely guarded by strong states.
The commitment to European integration requires a common vernacular, and that is English.
The challenge for Europe is to use English as such an instrument, while avoiding submersion in American and British culture.
The hens could never walk around freely, or lay eggs in a nest.
In the early 1970’s, when the modern animal-liberation movement began, no major organization was campaigning against the battery cage.
In Britain and some European countries, animal welfare became politically salient, and pressure on parliamentary representatives mounted.
But why is Europe so far ahead of other countries in its concern for animals?
Europe’s Fearful Natives
PARIS – A referendum in Switzerland forbids the construction of new minarets.
Racial violence explodes in the southern Italian region of Calabria.
Why not vote for the “real thing” if you can?
According to him, nothing would be more dangerous than to impose an artificial silence on a question that is boiling under the mask of political correctness.
One cannot preach what one does not fully practice.
For those who want to join the French and European project, it is a matter of values.
The problem is that fiscal federalism means different things to different people.
Europe, in this respect, is not qualitatively different from the US.
Europe’s Fight Against Terrorism
Three years ago this month, international terrorism struck Europe.
Last month the suspects went on trial in a Spanish court.
Third, we must counter the ideology of the terrorists.
They prefer to live in freedom and in parliamentary democracies.
So is torture.
As with CDOs, the EFSF was marketed as a way to reduce risk.
Europe is following a similar path.
The EFSF, created to assist countries facing “illiquidity,” is designed exactly like a CDO.
Among the major countries, however, only France and Germany have an AAA rating.
As Oscar Wilde said: “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.”
One is the need for banks and other financial institutions to hold liquid reserves.
Last year’s Northern Rock debacle in the United Kingdom will long remain an example of how not to manage such risk. 
The nature of these CMOs should have been apparent to risk managers.
Europe’s Financial Wasteland
But, if Eliot had been a professional investor who had observed European financial markets over the last few years, I am quite certain that his choice would have been August.
This year, BNP’s great rival, Société Générale, has been in the spotlight.
There is much – too much – competition for that position.
France likes to think that it is at the back of the field, strolling leisurely in lockstep with Germany.
EU banks are holding sovereign debt that clearly is not worth 100 cents on the euro.
One EU central banker described this to me as the “killer chart.”
Let us now turn to Europe.
But the ground under the euro may well begin to shift if things don’t change.
Europe\u0027s Gathering Political Storm
So what did Chirac and Jospin say on the subject?
Not a word.
Europe’s Global Mission
Europe is in search of its identity.
Let me explain what I mean.
The concept of an open society was first used by the French philosopher Henri Bergson in his book The Two Sources of Morality and Religion .
The other source is universal, leading to an open society guided by universal human rights that protects and promotes the freedom of the individual.
Karl Popper modified this scheme in his seminal book The Open Society and Its Enemies , published in 1944.
All that is needed now is for Europe’s people to be inspired by the idea of the EU as the prototype of a global open society.
What this means in principle can be stated concisely: the EU needs a common foreign policy.
In the meantime, the absence of institutional reform should not be allowed to serve as a pretext for inaction.
Needless to say, a common EU foreign policy should not be anti-American.
But not every aspect of financial regulation and macroeconomic performance necessarily belongs in this category.
Europe’s High Court Confronts Racism
Few go on to finish high school or attend university.
The Court’s hearing is set for March 1.
The second case comes from Bulgaria.
At the request of the Bulgarian government, the Court’s Grand Chamber agreed to review the matter before the end of February.
Just as Europe’s ethnic makeup has been changing, so have its laws.
The level of Greek interest rates shows that markets believe that Greece will default very soon.
European countries must finally and honestly acknowledge that, like the United States, Canada, and Australia, they are lands of immigrants.
The most important transformation is the emergence of new poles of attraction.
In the coming decade, most of the growth in migration will take place in the global south.
The aging of Europe’s population is historically unprecedented.
But all is not lost.
This leaves considerable room for improvement.
In fact, there are rays of hope in certain corners of Europe.
There are many other tools to advance integration.
We know how to ward off discrimination in hiring.
Today, the EU is making a more serious effort to engage its southern neighborhood.
No country is an island when it comes to migration, and none can address it alone.
Now a decade has passed since that bold pledge, and it is official: Europe is the world’s growth laggard rather than its champion.
Yet not a single country was ever penalized.
A subject worthy of Kafka and Molière.
Indeed, the first step toward a potential chain of government insolvencies in Europe has been taken.
This time is no different.
A case-by-case approach is therefore necessary.
As an organ of the EU, the EIB should be pursuing an ethical investment policy.
For example, British Petroleum (BP), to its credit, has disinvested from Iran on ethical grounds, an example that other European firms should follow.
Wishing the problem away will only make it worse.
Education is central here.
Europe’s Italian Muse?
When the euro was created, its architects were well aware that no monetary union in history had succeeded without the backing of a political union.
The term “transfer union” is now used, especially in Germany, as a pejorative synonym for federation.
Only specific governmental functions can.
New York’s government and people do not protest because Mississippi receives far more from the federal budget, relative to what it contributes, than New Yorkers do.
Europe’s Last Best Chance
Some experts, such as former ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, argue that fiscal consolidation would be expansionary.
In other words, the more generous and widespread the government benefits, the higher the required tax rate.
Europe’s Latest Revolution
STOCKHOLM – History often moves with small steps, but such steps sometimes turn out to have big implications.
This New Year’s Eve, Sweden made history in a small way by ending the last rotating foreign and security policy presidency of the European Union.
To be a model for the future, Europe’s governments and peoples must remain committed to an open Europe in an open world.
Approximately 150 million people in South-eastern Europe – the Western Balkans, Ukraine, and Turkey – aim at becoming EU citizens.
An open Europe must also be fully committed to an open global economy.
At daybreak, people line up before department stores to get the special “early bird” bargains.
Moreover, Blanchard fails to note that the preference for leisure is not gender-neutral.
While American women work 36 hours per week on average, Dutch women put in only 24 hours per week, while German women work 30 hours.
Europe’s Lost Decade
MILAN – “Never confess a failure.
For another ten years, it seems, we can talk big and dream.
What failed in the Lisbon Strategy?
Basically, everything – and the method, above all.
A clear case is environmental protection.
The 2012 Kyoto targets are attainable.
The so-called “blue-card” process has so far been largely unsuccessful, because there was no incentive for individual states to coordinate their policies.
Positioned on the eastern bank of the Suez Canal, Israel’s army was just over 100 kilometers from Cairo.
Europe does not have armed conflicts.
Like Egypt’s war of attrition, the eurozone’s underlying economic, financial, and social ferment continues.
To date, this has not happened.
Why should the few carry the many?
Europe\u0027s Military Revolution
This anti-American view, however, is not widely held.
Thus the challenges posed to America by Europe’s common and defense policy are primarily psychological.
Their leadership will need to be informal, transparent, and inclusive.
This year has been an excellent one for Europe’s economic growth.
For them, it seems out of the question that Europe can have two good years in a row.
There is also talk about a “Marshall Plan” for southern Europe.
Television shortens our horizons. No one thinks anymore about the long term.
But the Germans and French are now married within the Union.
For seven centuries, Hungary and Romania have been engaged in wars over territory and peoples.
Poland has known a thousand years of wars with its neighbors.
Today, it is secure.
The European venture is immense.
But that is already a lot.
This was as true yesterday as it is today.
The US must remain militarily involved - although it is the problem there today, it must also be a vital part of the solution.
But security cannot remain essentially in the hands of the Coalition.
The US must ultimately accept an East Timor-style solution for Iraq.
What does that mean?
Europe’s Moment of Decision
Fortunately, openly anti-European political programs are not the norm, at least not yet.
What, for example, should we make of Poland’s governing Kaczynski brothers?
Ironically, it is the German government’s loose talk that has brought Europe to the brink of another debt crisis.
What are the legal difficulties?
Spain’s financial exposure to Portugal and its housing-led recession don’t help matters.
But the size of Italy’s debt – and of Belgium’s – is worrisome.
After all, can anyone imagine French sailors eating “spotted dick” or any other culinary peculiarity of the Royal Navy?
If they get lucky, the rewards are immense.
Europe’s Naturalized Killers
But what do we really know about these killers among us?
Immigrants can establish themselves in new societies, and in democratic states they can live completely free of supervision.
Our freedoms are their tools.
Simply put, bombs dropped from several thousands meters do not kill less indiscriminately than explosive charges placed in train cars.
Europe’s Necessary Union
Joint financial backstops have been put in place.
Moreover, it is the start of something much bigger.
In Western Europe, it did not.
West European politicians, for their part, fear the opposite outcome.
But this will require a shift in the ECB’s attitude.
Europe\u0027s Never-Ending Constitution
Indeed, from the start, the architects of the Union's Constitutional Treaty never seriously expected that their draft would endure in the form in which they wrote it.
This pattern began at the start of the 'European project' over half a century ago.
The same is true of developments like the Union's common foreign and security policy or Monetary Union, with its Euro and European Central Bank.
At the same time, the European Parliament will have far greater powers.
Many people despair of finding their way through the maze of current EU treaties and their numerous amendments.
People are counting on Europe to take action.
The Constitutional Treaty provides solid foundations for our shared future.
Peace, security, and prosperity are as vulnerable as they are valuable.
This Treaty makes them stronger.
It is a new beginning.
Part of the confusion lies in Putin’s skillful political positioning.
Any company without a ".com" in its name or future seems doomed.
Perhaps only Europe's stock markets are the only ones participating yet, but that is a start.
Siemens is carving out a choice filet in the form of its semiconductor business to be offered as one of the largest European IPOs on record.
So far all of this has been a sideshow focused on Germany's ‘Neumarkt', but it is becoming a general focus of attention.
The new economy enjoys at least equal hype in Switzerland, Italy, Spain and France.
Europe’s New Watershed
This time Danish voters once again rejected the advice of their political establishment.
But too little emphasis was put on the political arguments.
A similar debate addressing key questions concerning the EU’s future should be launched now.
Fourth, the EU’s aspiration for a common foreign and security policy must be addressed.
The threats facing the world today are supranational, so counteracting them must be supranational, too.
The alternative is paralysis.
Europe’s Next Nightmare
Their Euro-skepticism certainly appears to be vindicated by events.
We are serious about this.
But member states should know by now that I am not a soft touch.
Now there are 27. Europe is a very different place. 
We have also undergone a communications and technological revolution that has touched every aspect of our lives.
They are wrong.
Europe is neither dead nor dying.
Once the original six core countries began to expand to include northern, southern, and, most recently, eastern European countries, the old federal vision was doomed.
Power in world politics today is distributed like a three-dimensional chess game that is played vertically as well as horizontally.
This hardly fits the description of a uni-polar world.
Fedor Dostoyevsky noted that Russia needed Europe, and that Europe was the second Russian fatherland.
But everything changed after the WWI and the Bolshevik revolution.
The sort of bridges we need require very different materials.
In the modern milieu of government and corporate bureaucracies, it is difficult to speak in these terms.
But “northern lights” may also correspond to what Europe, if not the entire West, needs nowadays: a political, economic, social, and ethical model.
Of course, it is dangerous to idealize the Scandinavian model.
To play the moral high ground, we must deserve it.
It is, of course, too early to tell.
Protectionism in the classical sense of the term is unlikely.
We have learned the lessons of 1929.
Youth unemployment in Spain, for example, is above 50%.
This money should be loaned out to small and medium-size enterprises, which are the lifeblood of Europe’s economy.
It finances crucial pan-EU transport and energy links.
Stories of corporate malfeasance do, of course, abound in the US.
Annual productivity growth actually slackened in the second half of the1990's, from 2.5% to just 1.3% today.
True, many new technologies were developed and first applied in the US.
But technology spreads rapidly: the same Windows or SAP programs are available in all countries, including Europe.
So there must be other differences.
This is where the US overtakes Europe: fewer people work in Europe than in the US, and those in Europe who do work don't work as much.
Annual hours worked in the US are about 1800, about 1500 in France, and 1400 in Germany.
But something deeper is at work.
This is particularly true in finance and banking.
In the US, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan did his job in 2001 and 2002, aggressively cutting interest rates.
Some governments--most notably France and Germany--are trying to do the second.
The dollar is depreciating, while the Euro is appreciating mightily. 
The Euro's appreciation may well be the tipping factor that triggers deflation.
What do members of the European Parliament (MEPs) actually do?
But this does not mean that the European Parliament is a “real” parliament.
Many of the 736 EU parliamentarians are unsung heroes who risk being seen more and more as a problem rather than a solution to the EU’s ills.
He did not mention Europe, but underestimating Europe’s power is a mistake.
It is fragmented, peaceful, and normative in a world of hard power, but part of the world is not about military power.
The first is the rise of Asia. The big question will be China and its internal evolution.
China has lifted 400 million people out of poverty since 1990, but another 400 million still live on less than $2 per day.
Here Europe’s economic might and soft power have a lot to contribute.
These doubts were moderated somewhat as America's strategy began to produce results.
But their people rightly demand that government should not just serve the interests of others.
What this distinct contribution could be is not difficult to define.
I am what many people call a “Gypsy.” I prefer the term “Roma.”
There are more than 10 million of us across Europe.
Indeed, we were so equal that the government gave many of us new, Bulgarian names.
But we were not equal.
We were second-class citizens.
This is not easy.
But if you succeed, this will change not only your life but also the lives of many of your people.”
They are either unemployed or working as unskilled laborers in Bulgaria or in the black market abroad.
By contrast, in large part because of my father, I managed to complete high school, then medical school, and become a general practitioner.
By the early 1990’s, Bulgaria had changed.
I obtained a law degree to help advocate for members of my community.
But I am an exception.
The Court’s decision allows this brutal and systematic violation of fundamental rights to continue.
The EU has multilateralism in its DNA.
Others, too, can benefit from its experience.
The EU is also doing its share of the heavy lifting.
It is this approach that underpins our external policy.
But more needs to be done.
The EU has multilateralism in its DNA.
It is also doing its share of the heavy lifting.
It is this approach that underpins our external policy.
Europe’s Scientific Meltdown
The Bologne protocol, which aims at harmonizing university training throughout Europe, could prove useful here.
The bluebrint provides for Kosovo’s “supervised independence,” maximum protection for Serb and other minorities, and a supervisory role for the EU.
Because of this, the EU's neighbors have felt magnetically attracted to this area of peace and prosperity.
Greece provides a good example.
The modernizing transformation now taking place in Greece owes much to the country's EU membership.
Much the same is true for Spain and Portugal.
As with Greece, democratic consolidation was at stake.
Neutrality prevented them from becoming candidates so long as the Soviet Union existed.
The motivation of the candidates who will join in 2004 is analogous.
Only Malta is a case in which the major interest in membership--access to the great common market--is economic.
The three Baltic states and Slovenia also want to entrench their recently revived national identities.
Right now, Europe has set its sight on political bonds that will be, for some time, impossible to establish.
But Europe also found a productive balance between church and state.
They were extracted from the churches, not granted by them.
Europe’s Short Vacation
Indeed, the recession will worsen throughout this year, for many reasons.
Irish voters may reject the fiscal compact in a referendum.
The peripheral countries suffer from severe stock and flow imbalances.
That debate is the result of the rejection of the draft treaty by French and Dutch voters in 2005.
Luxembourg’s voters, for example, approved it by a 56.5% majority immediately after the Dutch and French no votes.
Indeed, with two-thirds of member states and a majority of European citizens supporting the Treaty, it cannot simply be abandoned.
It may well be impossible to press ahead with the Treaty without any changes to the text.
Differentiation should not mean division, but rather progress at variable speeds.
Many generations of Poles dreamt of the day when Europe's postwar division would be undone.
Will the law serve all, or only the elites?
It would be hard to overestimate the importance of such a declaration.
We do not want a new Iron Curtain on the Polish-Ukrainian border.
Its location on the Black Sea ties it to Southeast Europe, the Balkans, and the Caucasus, as well as Turkey.
Their fears are warranted, because the current financial crisis is undermining the very union that was established to heal Europe’s wounds at the end of World War II.
Social exclusion is not only morally and legally repugnant; it also defies economic sense.
According to recent World Bank research, Roma comprise approximately 23% of new entrants into Bulgaria’s labor market.
In Romania, the figure is 21%.
I grew up in a small, impoverished town in central Serbia, where my parents lifted themselves out of extreme poverty and deprivation.
My father obtained a high school diploma and became a taxi driver, while my mother attended university and worked in a state office.
Thousands of Roma have made similar journeys.
Europe’s Stifled Celebration
But the tough question that has to be asked is whether the crisis could lead to the unraveling of European integration.
Third, there is the euro.
The 12 new member states that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 committed themselves to its adoption, but with no set date.
It is a model that has served new and old member states well.
Earlier this month, I gave a talk in Washington, DC, entitled “Hollande’s France: A Year After.”
The audience members’ average age was significantly higher than mine (and I am 66).
The complexities of French politics do not interest young Americans – and why should they?
For them, Europe is a continent undergoing museumification – a place to "do," not a place to be.
Learning European languages is no longer popular in American schools, with the possible exception of Spanish.
But is the US interested in Europe or only in parts of it?
Europe, given its current divisions and the growing gap between its northern and southern economies, still needs America.
But if they want the US to listen to them, they need to have something to say, and they need to say it together.
Europe’s Test in North Africa
Such a threat should not be taken lightly.
The same arc of development can and should be limned for the southern Mediterranean.
After all, it was the youth of North Africa, both at home and abroad, whose notions of freedom helped bring down dictators in Egypt and Tunisia.
It is high time that these ideas are implemented.
For us, the European Union was a dream.
Russia has become a different type of complicating factor for Europe.
That solution, while complicated, is a good outcome for the region.
Europe’s contemporary problems offer striking parallels with previous problems on the periphery of the world economy.
Today it is Europe’s turn.
The European crisis is coming full circle.
Sovereign debt no longer looks stable.
Exposure to Mexican debt alone represented some 90% of the capitalization of major US banks.
In the meantime, Latin America remained mired in what became widely known as “the lost decade.”
That is why the crisis has become a challenge for the UK, Germany, and France.
Europe’s Triple Threat
PALO ALTO – Europe is suffering from simultaneous sovereign-debt, banking, and currency crises.
Their deleveraging inhibits economic recovery.
Will it be Greek citizens?
German, French, and Dutch taxpayers?
Bondholders?
Finally, there is the path of public capital.
But how much public capital should be used, and on what terms?
Europe’s Trojan Horse
Or, if it doesn’t, the markets do.
If it is the Lisbon Treaty that creates these problems, then the Lisbon Treaty should be changed.
Worried about moral hazard?
Here’s your solution.
The special master would not be a fellow Californian, but he would be a fellow American.
They don’t interfere in the “sovereign prerogatives” of other member states.
Europe’s Troublesome Neighbors
But Europe is bordered to its south and east by two great regions that give cause for significant concern.
The West’s relations with Russia since the end of the Cold War have resembled the meeting of two tectonic plates, with one progressively forced beneath the other.
The Georgia conflict of 2008 was the tremor that signaled substantial resistance to the western plate’s eastward movement.
Islam is its identifying glue – but how much else do Indonesia and Yemen, for example, have in common?
Al Qaeda’s agenda is as much about the creation of a new Islamic caliphate as it is about waging jihad against the West.
Ours is a guilt culture; theirs a shame culture.
Europe is not without leverage.
From 2001 to 2005, there was a “silent revolution” in Germany.
This is no longer possible.
The right interest rate for the French and Italians is too low for the Germans.
But the prospect of permanent stagnation for countries like France, Italy, and Portugal is unacceptable.
Chronic stagnation is too high a price to pay for adopting the euro.
So they are taking refuge in fantasy.
The ECB President made it clear he will do his duty whatever the political pressure.
Some in France – and not just the left – want to change this.
The EU, being the product of several great religious and philosophical traditions, is a community of values.
The ideas of the Greeks and Romans, Christianity, Judaism, humanism, and the Enlightenment have made us who we are.
Dialogue with Islamic and Arabic cultures also helped form our identity.
They broadened and deepened European cooperation.
A new generation of politicians is ready to carry the torch onwards.
But is the torch still burning bright?
In the early 1950s, Jean Monnet wrote: "We are not forming a coalition of states.
We are uniting people."
Apparently not.
They do not feel part of the great whole.
The emphasis on pure self-interest increases this threat.
The result is an impression of Europe as a marketplace.
We will make it a reality through dialogue and deep reflection about Europe's common values.
Europe\u0027s University Challenge
Which works better?
But competition is as important as financing in determining a university's quality, because competition increases the merit of the product.
The University of California at Berkeley is public. Stanford University, an hour away down the coast, is private.
Both are among America's finest universities.
Competition between them works because it involves fighting for the best students and offering scholarships to deserving poor ones.
What has gone so wrong?
The population at large just does not understand what links raising the retirement age with the crisis.
Europe’s Vital French Connection
It has the largest economy, accounting for 28% of eurozone GDP and 25% of the eurozone’s population.
Indeed, he took the lead in adding a “growth pact” to the “stability pact” that had been negotiated under Merkel’s leadership.
And French is still a global language.
In other words, France not only is a link between Europe’s north and south, but also contributes substantially to linking Europe to the rest of the world.
Europe\u0027s War of Big and Small
When the European enterprise started, there were three small and three large countries; but almost all the new members are small countries.
They cannot both be right. 
Don't bet on it. 
Europe’s New Year’s Irresolution
This is also true, more generally, of German dominance of the EU.
We should wish Europe a successful year, but it would be foolish to bet on it.
Instead of the convergence prescribed by the Maastricht Treaty, the radical narrowing of interest-rate differentials generated divergences in economic performance.
Europe’s Zombie Banks
BRUSSELS – What is wrong with Europe’s banks?
But reliance on cheap central bank (re)financing does not represent a viable business model.
There are problems north of the Alps as well.
It is thus essential to analyze the situation of each bank separately.
But it will be unable to review the longer-term viability of banks’ business models.
We have global supply lines in which goods are developed in one country, manufactured in another, and assembled in a third.
If your mobile phone was assembled in India, but developed and designed in Finland, is it an Indian or a Finnish product?
Although manufactured in China and Vietnam, shoes were designed, developed, and marketed in Europe.
To create a completely level playing field in trade is impossible.
Europe Through American Eyes
Not even pacific Scandinavia is exempt from this.
According to Time magazine, 400,000 European researchers now work in the US.
Indeed, India now has some of the world's best engineers, IT technicians and medical professionals.
India probably encompasses the world's largest middle class.
It is, however, no more unfair than how America is regularly portrayed in Europe's media these days.
Europe without Turkey
AMSTERDAM – Most European citizens (for example, more than 60% in France and Germany) believe that Turkey should not become part of the European Union.
Good question.
And some of its new members – Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, for example – are not exactly paragons of open liberal democracy.
But the same goes for the Europeans.
Without Turkey, EU involvement in the Middle East still looks like Western imperialism.
But not all European citizens are practicing Christians.
Many are not Christians at all.
Such a process cannot be forced on people.
And times might change.
European Defense and European Solidarity
Any weighty occurrence provokes repercussions across the continent.
For a living society cannot be restructured from above.
Thus Europe must help its new democracies to become an organic part of a shared Continental commitment to a deepening and advancement of civil society.
This psychological preparedness should be utilized to advance Europe’s material and technical preparedness.
Such a Constitution needs two parts.
European Exceptionalism
The eurozone constitutes a “society of states” of a completely new type, one that transcends the traditional Westphalian concept of sovereignty.
Like individuals in a society, eurozone countries are both independent and interdependent.
The Council, meanwhile, appears to anticipate the European Parliament’s future upper house, with the lower house already elected by all EU citizens.

European Expansion or Putin Expansion?
They felt that enlargement even to the Scandinavian and Alpine countries was going too far.
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, which were annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, slipped in under the wire in 2004.
Ukraine is big, and Georgia is far away in the Caucasus.
Ukraine, a country of 47 million people, has seen itself as a prospective EU candidate since 2004, when the Orange Revolution forced the country’s rulers to respect election rules.
Belarus is different.
Since the USSR’s collapse, a new generation has come of age throughout the region.
The EU’s current model – the “single passport” with home-country regulation of financial institutions – has failed on an embarrassing scale.
The Baltic economies are perhaps the most tragic victims, but the damage stretches across Central and Eastern Europe and down into the Balkans.
But the simultaneous occurrence and high visibility of these problems is less significant than they appear.
The second half of the twentieth century witnessed the victory of the market economy over the administered economy.
The left, which had previously looked to Marx, lost its bearings.
This should be the task for social democrats – but that is where the shoe pinches.
That is an odd position to take, to say the least.
Imagine that the US federal government decided that it no longer wanted to support Mississippi and demanded support for that poor southern state from the IMF.
The eurozone wants it both ways.
Many are now radically changing their business models to reduce risk.
Bank subsidiaries will increasingly have to finance local lending with local deposits and other local funding.
For starters, the Basel III package of global banking reforms and the European Union’s corresponding Capital Requirements Directive IV rule create disincentives for cross-border financing.
ALESSANDRIA, ITALY – Tax evasion is a global scourge.
The Chinese have devised a novel solution.
Similar systems are in use in Taiwan and Latin America.
The bulk of claims for the subsidy come from northern Italy, which is usually considered less prone to tax evasion to begin with.
Even the Sheriff Upholds the Law
The most famous example came in 1917.
We have no feeling toward them but one of sympathy and friendship.
Only the Kaiser and his evil henchmen were to blame.
Every American president since Wilson has, at least once while in office, uttered the phrase “have no quarrel with” a foreign enemy.
More than one-third of Americans in 1917 could trace their heritage back to Germany and its allies.
The war in the Pacific was a race war.
It is global in nature.
And the many kinds of small RNA molecules are increasingly recognized as forming a regulatory layer above the genome.
This brings us back to where we started.
But, while that implies that emerging-market currencies must strengthen, disorderly appreciations would do more harm than good.
Indeed, the only growth sector seems to be books about Italy’s decline.
As a result, the debt-to-GDP ratio declined only modestly until 2004 and rose again – to more than 106% – in 2005.
Italian voters are perplexed.
Exit the Political Wife
Germany’s president, Joachim Gauck, is not married to his partner, the journalist Daniela Schadt, and no one seems to care.
Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, is not married to his partner, the domesticity guru Sandra Lee, and no one seems to care.
The list could easily be continued.
It is true that in America, at least, hay can still be made from the role of political wife.
Those days now seem like another age.
In America in this election cycle, as in Europe, headlines are absent that in the past would have raised questions about an unmarried female partner, a working woman, a woman with a life of her own.
The role achieved its apotheosis with someone who, perhaps not coincidentally, was trained as an actress.
“I don’t talk about political matters,” she famously said.
“That’s not my department.”
For starters, recent events have made it highly unappealing to any woman who has any alternative to assuming it.
Exiting from Democracy?
Judging from their recent statements, the scenario that they are concocting is simple.
In January, there will be elections in Iraq.
Withdrawal will begin next spring.
Indeed, Iraq no longer deserves to be described as a united country.
Without elections, the Coalition is in trouble.
Above all, however, Iraq is in trouble.
What other way forward is there for that unhappy former country?
The answer need not be all despair.
In "tribal" societies, this is not easy to bring about.
In fact, they established what are now the Länder of the Federal Republic of Germany.
It would establish what might be called the "Turkish solution."
It would make the exit of occupation forces more complex and perhaps more drawn-out.
Exiting International Justice
After all, at Nuremberg, the top rung of the Third Reich was tried and convicted within months.
Indeed, Serbia’s last presidential election became something of a referendum on Milosevic – and hence on Serbia’s relations with the West and the wider world.
What will be the Tribunal’s legacy?
What about ethnic reconciliation?
Del Ponte has called for “new partnerships for justice.”
The ICTY’s responsibility should be to forge and disseminate a record that limits the possibility of historical denial.
But reference to “talks” makes the West uncomfortable.
Kosovo was left as a United Nations protectorate whose “final status” was uncertain.
Similarly, any move by Bosnia’s Serb Republic to secede could incite instability there.
Serbia wants as much independence as possible for the Serb Republic, while asserting its own sovereignty over Kosovo.
But appeasement has failed.
The younger brother, Chime Namgyal, 38, who is disabled, has been hospitalized since June 11 for serious injuries received whilst in custody.
And, last year, the One Foundation, a humanitarian fund run by the film star Jet Li, awarded him one million renminbi by for his “model project.”
Indeed, a book praising the brothers for their work, Tianzhu (“Heavenly Beads”), was published in China late last year, to wide acclaim.
This theory has gained credence because the Communist Party’s current leader in the Tibet Autonomous Region formerly held a powerful position in Xinjiang Province.
China’s central government has the power to rein in its local chieftains, so its failure to do so in Tibet is puzzling.
Expansion and Democracy in Europe
Both should be treated as inextricably linked.
It is an historical necessity.
It must receive full sovereignty over EU budget-making and the right to sign-off on all decisions taken by a qualified majority in the Council.
Membership in the EU should not be the determining factor in European statecraft.
Expansion is Solidarity
This is the very meaning of the word “solidarity,” as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary: “unity resulting from feelings and sympathies.”
Should we fear the fact that Europe is no longer a purely Jewish/Christian and white continent?
They are particularly difficult if we see culture as the cement of Europe’s future.
Look at the growing number of prominent citizens of Turkish origin in Germany.
But Europeans must admit that these individuals represent a small minority.
In fact, Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il, were typical Korean rulers.
For the Kim dynasty to survive, the threat of external enemies is essential.
Apart from anything else, there is an important domestic political reason for US reticence: a Democratic US president cannot afford to look “soft.”
It also presupposes a European budget that is sufficient to meet expectations and equal to the challenges that await.
Indeed, they are in large part the same problem.
Are Brazilians too exuberant?
But, at other times, the stories seem more solid.
While such words merit caution, economy fundamentals bear them out.
Why haven’t the stories of corruption caused a crisis, as similar scandals did in Korea and Malaysia during the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98?
Eyeball to Eyeball at the Top of the World
After all, you don’t hear Canada’s foreign minister denying tension on his country’s American frontier, because the truth of that proposition is self-evident.
The previous month, there were reports of an armed Chinese probe 12 kilometers into the north-eastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.
What is going on?
At the same time, China has taken pains to remind India that it still claims a further 92,000 square kilometers, mainly in Arunachal Pradesh.
It doesn’t help that the two countries share the longest disputed frontier in the world, since the LAC has never been formally delineated in a manner accepted by both sides.
With the LAC coming into being in the wake of China’s victory in 1962, the situation is even more unclear.
The reasons are not hard to identify.
So the Sino-Indian frontier is unlikely to remain quiet.
Eyes Wide Shut on Global Warming
The Kyoto Treaty on controlling climate change was, as Harvard professor Rob Stavins puts it, “too little, too fast.”
Providing the proper incentives for effective research and development will not be easy.
Perhaps we will continue to close our eyes.
Facing Nature’s Fury
As human populations crowd new parts of the planet and come into contact with new animal habitats, new infectious diseases spread from animals to humans.
There is a growing body of expertise to help get the job done.
Using advanced statistical and mapping methods, they identified how these various threats are arrayed around the world.
The good news is that we have the science and the technology to address these risks better than we ever have.
We can build a safer future, but only if we are prepared to use our scientific knowledge and expertise for the common good.
Facing the Deflationary Threat
For example, the US experienced chronic deflation at the 19 th century's end.
Much the same thing happens today.
Since Hong Kong's currency board prevents inflation in HK dollar prices, the HK dollar prices of local goods must fall.
But can central banks stabilize a falling price index as effectively as a rising one?
The Bank of Japan's overnight interest rate has been essentially zero since 1999, but prices still fall.
It was more concerned with posing as an inflation-fighter.
A Muslim community in the United Arab Emirates is very different from one in Nigeria, and both are very different from Islam in Indonesia.
Yet there are some obvious similarities as well.
This process implies that political mobilization is inevitable, facilitated by the fragmenting of Russian society and the weakness of Russia's national identity.
Two distinct parts of this problem exist.
President Bush's rhetorical slip about a ``crusade'' against terrorism was one such response.
We must now take this collaboration a step further.
In the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia, old rivalries now unfold in a nuclear context.
If Iran’s mobile missiles disperse, Israel wants to know about it immediately.
China, too, is shifting its nuclear forces to mobile missiles and submarines.
Failing states in Central America
The evidence from Guatemala is particularly worrying.
This is true as much as for the rest of Central America – with the general exception of Costa Rica and Panama – as it is for Guatemala alone.
The condition of the Central American judiciary is at the heart of the prospect of state failure.
Significant improvements to this situation will be hard won.
Failing the Syria Test
There are three key implications of the Security Council’s vote.
This is clearly so in the Islamic world.
Christianity is also growing – in odd ways and in surprising places.
Religion’s largest growth is in China.
And, of course, Confucianism – a philosophy rather than a religion – is deeply revered.
To a degree, this has always been so.
But such a world requires that mutual respect replace mutual suspicion.
On the contrary, it requires a special focus.
I started my Faith Foundation precisely to create greater understanding between the faiths.
We are just one organization.
The Alliance of Civilizations, begun by Spain and Turkey, is one example.
This would be a tragedy.
Religion isn’t dying; nor should it.
Famine and Hope in the Horn of Africa
NAIROBI – Yet again, famine stalks the Horn of Africa.
Pastoralism has long been a harrowing existence in the Horn of Africa.
Somalia, for example, contains only a part of the Somali-speaking pastoralist population, with large numbers living across the border in Kenya and Ethiopia.
When the rains fail there, wars begin.
Obama responded that the US Congress would not support a major development effort for the drylands.
Unless and until widespread family planning and modern contraceptive services are established, expanding populations in the Horn of Africa will crash against a harsher future climate.
The countries of the Horn of Africa are now stepping forward to help themselves through this approach.
The Islamic Development Bank, representing the 57 members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, is also showing leadership.
But the north-south divide is now obsolete.
A third tier is made up of roughly 50 middle-income countries with a combined population of 1.1 billion.
Both have their characteristic benefits and costs.
Circuit-breakers are in place nowadays to prevent a 1929-style slide into disaster.
One cannot think of any natural science in which orthodoxy swings between two poles.
Their systems trap them in orthodoxy.
When events shift, it becomes obsolete.
By the early 1990’s, it became increasingly evident that the armed struggle for power in Latin American was winding down.
The SDP had promised that the base would leave Japan.
The Hatoyama government’s floundering was not confined to the issue of the US base on Okinawa.
ATLANTA – We are, supposedly, in the midst of an obesity epidemic.
Everyone is getting fatter. Children are fatter than their parents.
Epidemics caused by fat are now manifest: Type 2 diabetes, increased rates of heart and cardiovascular disease, and notably more cancers, such as breast cancer.
But are people really so unhealthily fat?
At his death, Lambert was remembered as a man of great “temperance.”
Of course, in a “real” human being any number of these causes – social, psychological, or genetic – may be at work.
So, are we getting too fat?
What about the transfer of power to a new generation?
There is a wide range of views in the new Palestinian leadership.
But if Muhammad al-Ghuneim does indeed become the new leader, the prospects for any peace at all look grim.
Fear and Freedom on the Internet
The blogger, Zhao Jing, had been reporting on a strike by journalists at The Beijing News that followed the dismissal of the newspaper’s independent-minded editor.
But the MSN Spaces sites are maintained on servers in the United States.
The newspaper is under no obligation to do it for them.
So Microsoft’s defense misfires.
To be sure, a corporation can and should place limits on the use of its services.
If we agree with Mill, then only one of Gates’s examples falls into the category of expression that should be protected.
We may therefore restrict both of them without running afoul of Mill’s argument.
This is precisely the point.
Expressions of nationalism in postwar European democracies were always tolerated in soccer stadiums, not in public life.
This has not yet happened in Europe, not even in Austria.
But Saakashvili and his allies are all young.
Similarly, Georgia's inability to manage relations with its only autonomous republic, Adzharia, doesn't inspire much confidence.
Cell phones and the Internet link the minds of many people in different countries effortlessly and efficiently, encouraging trade in intellectual creations.
Thus, while most respondents said they were not worried, nearly half expressed some worry.
We must not let this happen.
Fear of Finance
As Franklin D. Roosevelt put it, we must cast down the “money changers” from their “high seats in the temple of our civilization.”
We don’t know.
Fearless Financial Markets
This may be the situation that the world financial system is in now.
Don’t get me wrong: somewhat more than half my brain agrees with Rubin, Summers, Wolf, and company.
Feeling Rich
People must feel that their own social group, however they define it, will eventually benefit.
Female Genital Mutilation Mutilates Us All
On December 10th, women from around the world will gather at the European Parliament to fight against Female Genital Mutilation.
Female genital mutilation, according to the WHO, consists of the "removal of all or part of the external female genital organs."
Should we incarcerate all women who carry out these mutilations on their fellow women?
We need to reach into politics, because there will be no freedom for African, Arab, or Asian women without the advent of political democracy in their countries.
Those people made the fight against female genital mutilation a priority in their lives.
Feminism and the Male Brain
Women complained of not being heard, of men disappearing after work to tinker in the garage or zone out in front of the TV.
What Could He Be Thinking? , by Michael Gurian, a consultant in the field of neurobiology, takes this set of insights further.
Fictional Sovereignties
A thousand miles to the west of Georgia is Moldova (population 3.5 million), which lies between Romania and Ukraine.
Annexed by Tsarist Russia in 1812, joined to Romania in 1918, and re-annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, it seized its independence from Moscow in 1991.
It also produces rather good wine.
It is said to have close links to the president and his family.
It has built a giant football stadium in the capital, Tiraspol, which seems to be some kind of symbol of Transdniestrian virility.
Of course, this would be a recipe for global anarchy.
So the unraveling of multi-national states is a false path.
Such a cavalier attitude to the demands of lesser powers to be heard is no longer possible.
In democracies, repeated elections lead to short-term policy choices.
The bean for which Proctor was granted a patent is a farmers’ variety, originally from Mexico and in the public domain for centuries.
The story began in 1994, when Proctor purchased a bag of beans in Mexico.
Undoubtedly, international institutions and countries in the global South have far more urgent goals than to spend resources suing greedy companies.
Of the 275,000 women who die of cervical cancer annually, 85% live in the world’s poorest countries.
Fighting Terror Among the Believers
The flames of Islamic fundamentalism are not confined to the Middle East and Central Asia.
The bomb blasts that rocked Kuta, Bali near midnight last October 12th profoundly effected almost every aspect of Indonesian life.
The stakes for Indonesia are high.
In essence, extremism and fundamentalism can be countered only from within the faith.
Fighting Terrorism Democratically
For some, that is a price worth paying; for others, the costs seem too high.
It is because Britain is a democracy that respects the rule of law that it has been able to mobilize vast sectors of its Muslim community.
Fighting the \
Nowadays, instruments of mass destruction are smaller, cheaper, and more readily available.
Cellular phones were used as timers in the attacks in Madrid last March.
Al Qaeda is said to have established a network in fifty or more countries.
In the l980's, the worst terrorist incident killed 300 people.
This escalation occurred without using weapons of mass destruction.
Deliberate killing of non-combatants (in war or not) is condemned by most major religions, including Islam.
Bombing is not an option for fighting terrorist cells in Hamburg, Singapore, or Detroit.
Fighting the Aids Pandemic
The pandemic has claimed 19 million lives, and created 13 million orphans.
In parts of Southern Africa more than 20% of adults are afflicted.
Poverty makes medical treatment expensive, so poor people with AIDS often hide their disease because there is no point in having tests if treatment doesn’t follow.
Poverty also induces husbands to work away from home as migrant laborers, creating an environment in which sex with multiple partners is more likely.
The genetic characteristics of HIV in Southern Africa are also different from HIV in America and Europe.
HIV/AIDS is the greatest pandemic in modern history.
The third step must be an expanded program of research and development into new and more effective approaches to controlling the disease.
Will the European Commission lose what remains of its credibility and end up looking like a minor Parisian arrondissment ?
Fighting Words and False Promises
Clearly, it wonâ€™t be the last.
It is not our will that is being tested, but our understanding of reality.
But not admitting it is bound to prove even more painful in the long run.
That is the test that now confronts us.
Finance Agonistes
A recent analysis by Andy Haldane of the Bank of England of long-term returns on UK financial sector equities suggests that the last 25 years have been very unusual.
But the period from 1986 to 2006 was radically different.
To be sure, CEOs of major banks have been forced out before.
But Diamond was a banker supposedly at the top of his game.
Diamond started to fight back, pointing an accusatory finger at the Bank of England.
At that point, he had to go.
First, the political backlash was not from backbenchers or uninformed spectators on the margins of the mainstream.
As Eduardo Porter of The New York Times put it,
“Bigger markets allow bigger frauds.
Bigger companies, with more complex balance sheets, have more places to hide them.
Second, Diamond apparently thought that he could take on the British establishment.
The regulators called his bluff and forced him to resign.
Meanwhile, the European situation looks explosive.
The lessons of 1914 are about more than simply the dangers of national animosities.
They view the US move as a new sort of financial protectionism and are threatening retaliation.
But financial pressure can be much more powerfully applied to countries that are deeply embedded in the global economy.
That kind of thinking brought war in 1914.
The role that high oil prices played in the summer of 2008 in tipping the global economy into recession should not be underestimated.
Indeed, Laos was among the worst-affected countries.
This summer and fall, I revisited many of the affected countries, including Malaysia, Laos, Thailand, and Indonesia.
A Hacker’s Market?
NEW YORK – Never in the history of written communication could 140 characters have the impact that they can have now.
At his afternoon briefing, White House press secretary Jay Carney confirmed that Obama was indeed unharmed.
If protecting against hoaxes is not the market’s purview, can news agencies or new media entities like Twitter prevent such deception?
What about the AP’s vulnerabilities?
Finally, the AP is unlikely to face financial penalties for this mistake.
And thatraises another question: whom can we trust?
In the 1990’s, Argentina tied its hands with a dollar-pegged currency in order to enhance its credibility as a borrower.
Real debt defaults are historically rare.
The case of my own firm, Christofferson, Robb &amp; Company (CRC), illustrates how private capital markets can finance renewable energy when the subsidy is right.
The wind farms that we built convert the wind’s kinetic energy into electricity.
The revenues gained from selling the electricity is used to repay CRC Breeze Finance’s long-term debt.
The US has no offshore wind farms, and no prospect of having any for at least five years.
Such ships would take two years to build, at a cost $50,000,000.
No one, insofar as I know, is rushing to build one.
The reasons for offshore wind’s failure to fulfill its promise in the United Kingdom are equally straightforward and have nothing to do with a lack of money.
If investors sense that new projects may obtain special treatment, everyone will decide to wait.
I believe that this amount could be at least doubled and assured for a longer time span.
Financing the Green Economy
It will require a mix of new public sources, a scaling-up of existing public sources, and increased private flows.
Among the AGF’s conclusions, which we have presented to the UN Secretary-General, there are some important messages:
We need to make progress on establishing the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund, including, possibly, regional and thematic vehicles, such as an Africa Green Fund.
And, America’s is the only for-profit health system of the entire bunch.
But, in energy-efficient Switzerland, energy use is just 100 kg per $1,000 of GDP, and in Demark it is just 110 kg, compared with 190 kg in the US.
On average, the rich countries emit 2.3 kg of CO2 for every kg of oil-equivalent unit of energy.
Yet there is hope for those at lower latitudes as well.
Tropical Costa Rica also ranks near the top of the happiness league.
Japan made that mistake in 1998-2000, just as the US did in 1937-1939.
So how should we square the policy circle?
Staff members rushed to find my car on fire.
I refused.
Armenia’s paramount oligarch fumed.
We will not be defeated.
An incinerated car is a small price to pay in the battle for freedom.
Firewalls to Freedom
First Things First: Americans, or Ethics?
There is no world political community.
Was it traditional fiscal conservativism?
Was it to do what Democrats do, but do it better?
Willard: “I don’t see any method at all, sir.”
Let’s pretend that the United States had such a government.
It is highly likely that desired health expenditures will be enormous for some things and trivial for others.
This is, of course, why state-run health-care systems came into being.
Growth in the United States and parts of Europe returned.
Negative growth is not.
But do we really want to see the US leveraged up to its ears again?
Probably not.
The problem is that it can’t, even with a depreciating currency.
None of these steps are easy.
But that is precisely why a government-managed mortgage market is dangerous.
Credit risk in the mortgage market is being assumed by the government, and market risk by the Fed.
No private party would buy such an asset.
Evictions merely create more homeless people and more vacant homes.
Furthermore, it used its political muscle to block the early warning about its deficit that the EU Commission had mandated by the terms of the Stability Pact. 
Now France is making waves.
The EU's reluctant number two country has served unofficial notice that it, too, does not plan to abide by its deficit-reduction promises.
No warning was issued. 
France's case is different.
Knowing that any slippage today will need to be dealt with tomorrow, they exercise their best judgment.
The same approach should work for fiscal policy.
Fixing the Food Chain
But are governments getting the message?
I believe so.
Both public and private investments are needed to provide such access.
International institutions are needed to regulate globalization and ensure trade competition.
And, in many cases, no supply chain is in place.
The result is a broken supply chain.
How obvious is that?
Moreover, strict conditions must be met to prove genocide.
The eurozone has been at the epicenter of this contractionary force on global growth.
Food for Revolution
PRINCETON – Summits are defined by their location.
The North Koreans lied in writing not only to the United States, which it has done repeatedly in the past, but also to China, Russia, Japan, and South Korea.
But it did, and, in the wake of the Korean War, that line would become – and remain – one of the most heavily fortified borders on earth.
Will China accept a unified peninsula under a US ally?
Although Kenya has a well-functioning and well-funded agricultural research system, the government has not even permitted field tests of GM crop varieties.
But why are developing-country governments dragging their feet?
It is unusual that a new technology has no negative side effects.
Fourth, pollen from GM crops may “contaminate” organically produced food.
Food or Fuel?
Then he was in Brazil, where he was impressed by the country’s use of bio-fuel to power a quarter of its automotive traffic.
Oil pressed from rapeseed can be used as diesel fuel, and maize or sugar beets can yield ethanol to replace gasoline.
Wood stores carbon, owing to photosynthesis.
But such land is usually wooded.
Indeed, every year, the world loses forest area the size of Ireland.
It makes no sense to use land in whatever form to produce bio fuels.
That option should be supported.
Football and Philosophy
How can the trajectory of a ball cause so much pain or bliss?
For weeks I have sat at my television watching the World Cup.
What is the source of this attraction, this magic?
The world of play is our permanent Garden of Eden.
Football and the Garden of Eden?
What do they have to do with each other?
In the world of play freedom is generated, paradoxically, by restrictions.
In soccer, the basic rule is simple: the ball is to be moved, from the central point, into one of the goals.
To generate freedom, rules put obstacles in the way of the ball and complicate its movement.
Second, they are told to get the ball into opposite goals.
A ball is freedom embodied.
It may bounce in any direction.
It is an object and, nevertheless, it seems to be free.
It has its own universe.
It moves in the sphere of the sacred.
But that sacred does not exist without the profane.
The football field is marked off and opposed to the surrounding world.
They rage and love, prance and explode, and finally reach a catharsis (if their team wins) or to descend into hell (if their team loses ).
They act according to clear, sacred rules.
They move in the world of pure morality and justice.
The two teams change sides at the half.
Players, too, are not supposed to break the rules.
Football is War
NEW YORK – The flags are already flying, from Holland to Argentina, from Cameroon to Japan.
It’s that time again: the World Cup is upon us.
Tensions between the two countries were already high.
Football is an opportunity to experience the thrill of combat, without risking much more than a few broken bones.
Tennis does not create frenzy on a national scale.
After all, these forms of combat are between two individuals, not two tribes.
Koestler himself, born in Budapest but a proud British citizen, remained a Hungarian football nationalist all his life.
The tribe can be a club, a clan, or a nation.
Before World War II, football clubs often had an ethnic or religious component: Tottenham Hotspur in London was “Jewish,” while Arsenal was “Irish.”
Vestiges of these markings remain: Ajax of Amsterdam is still taunted by provincial opponents as the “Jew club.”
And the Glasgow clubs, Celtic and Rangers, are still divided by religious affiliation, Celtic being Catholic and Rangers Protestant.
Not all football games are fraught with negative feeling and violence.
Which is Holland, of course, the country of my birth.
The feelings inspired by the latter are by far the stronger.
Spain’s victory was one of the rare occasions that Catalonians, Castillians, Basques, and Andalusians erupted together in an explosion of patriotic delight.
As a famous Dutch soccer coach once said, not in jest: “Soccer is war.”
It was not supposed to be like this.
Nationalism was blamed for almost destroying the old continent twice in the 20th century.
They are exceptional.
These feelings can be festive, even carnival-like, as they were in Euro 2008.
But they can contain something darker, more aggressive, too, especially when sporting combat is loaded with historical memory.
Yet Germans, too, are unable to suppress such feelings.
Older Germans can still remember their famous victory over a superb Hungarian team in 1954.
Like everything else, forms of patriotism change over time.
Others had ancestral roots in various parts of Africa.
In fact, the French were harbingers of a kind.
I have never seen such harmony between the supporters of different nations as in this year’s championship.
Perhaps it was due to the absence of England, whose fans include the last bands of amateur warriors.
Perhaps because Spain played more beautiful football.
Or perhaps it just shows my age.
It is important that the US take the lead in this crucial aspect of state-building.
Now, trade deficits are like hot potatoes.
Nobody wants them, so they get passed around.
For Turkey, For Europe
Turkey is now, finally, negotiating with the European Commission the terms of its possible membership in the European Union.
At least half of the body of Greek theater and philosophy was produced in Asia Minor.
The first Christian evangelization trips of Saint Peter and Saint Paul were to Turkey.
America has a savings deficiency, not a glut.
And the rest of the world?
Divide the world into three zones: the United States, China, and all the rest.
And here we face a difficulty.
PARIS – With every passing week, the Syrian conflict increasingly resembles the Spanish Civil War.
There are even deeper similarities.
This time, they hold the better cards.
Meanwhile, the European Union is fighting for its survival, and cannot devote its energies to an uncertain battle.
With the Arab world in the midst of upheaval, what message does the West want to send?
But, above all, let us not forget the lessons of the Spanish Civil War.
Indeed, Europe’s community of attitudes is becoming synonymous with solutions to world problems.
There are divergent views on many vital global problems.
Shaping a shared vision of the world should start with Europe’s immediate neighborhood.
The EU’s current lack of unanimity on many world issues, as well as continental issues such as Ukraine, is no reason for despair.
Forging Asia’s Missing Links
1. Abandon the Taiwan independence movement;
4. Discuss Taiwan’s participation in international organizations under the “One China” umbrella;
6. Promote China’s traditional civilization with strengthened spiritual ties.
But there is a major obstacle to easing tensions: the proposed $6.5 billion sale by the United States to Taiwan of 30 Apache attack helicopters and 330 Patriot missiles.
Forging Syria’s Opposition
Assad’s regime is doomed.
President Putin’s restoration of the old Soviet national anthem was the first recent hint that Russians are marching back to the future.
Although Putin did have the decency to change the words, he retained the Soviet spirit - “great Russia united forever.”
All of these are seen as Kremlin games, hypothetical and hypocritical, bearing little relation to reality.
Whatever anthem, old or new or none at all, under which these things appear will be deemed suitable, and maybe even be sung.
I saw them in Moscow too; then in Novosibirsk.
Pizzeria Venezia proclaimed a sign with a carving of a gondola.
Globalization and someone’s vague idea – no, dream – of la dolce vita had reached the depths of Russia.
If Putinism means that, perhaps Russia is moving forward after all.
Some interesting ideas have been floated.
Thus, the US urgently needs to begin making four serious changes.
The third tool is credit policy.
This brings us to the fourth tool: fiscal policy.
Fragile and Unbalanced in 2012
Asian economies are exposed to China.
Central and Eastern Europe are exposed to the eurozone.
To paraphrase Bette Davis in All About Eve, “Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy year!”
Hollande’s proposal was initially regarded as lèse-majesté against Germany.
Hollande’s predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, tried to address this problem.
But Hollande quickly reversed both of these reforms.
France à la Sarkozy
He is also preparing to raise the retirement age to 61, from 60.
What worked then may work now.
By rejecting the euro, Sweden, itself a small country, made it clear that it didn't want to be part of a Europe that discriminated against small countries.
Many of them are already in place.
A UN staff protected by US marines simply cannot do that job.
It is time for both to realize that the consequences of inaction will be no less severe for the region than for the Atlantic relationship.
France in Search of Europe
With its ten new members, the European Union comprises 25 countries and 453 million citizens.
Hungarians and Romanians, after nine centuries of hatred and wars, are embarking on the same process.
The project of the new European Constitution was devised to remedy this problem.
And, lo and behold, France, which is scheduled to ratify the Constitution by a referendum on May 29, gives the impression of wanting to vote against it.
Although every member nation has played its part in integrating Europe, France has without doubt been the country that provided most of the ideas and master builders.
So what is going on?
France Is Back In Europe, But On What Terms?
Sarkozy will need to take all this into account if he wants France to play a full part in shaping the EU’s future.
France is Not Working
In 1970, a quarter of all pensioners lived in poverty; today, the figure is only 4%.
After all, whatever the deeper causes of the French Revolution of 1789, the immediate trigger was a public-finance crisis.
This is clear from the remarkable recent experience of “Sciences Po,” one of the elite  grandes écoles in the center of Paris.
That was the purpose of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which established the European Union.
The European project has clearly failed to achieve what French political leaders have wanted from the beginning.
Europe’s international role is shrinking, with the old G-5 having evolved into the G-20.
France’s Fourth Moment
As a result, Germany bound itself to the idea of “ever closer union” even more definitively by pledging to join the common European currency, the euro.
The issue is partly one of “internationalism” itself.
The youngsters who are ravaging France realize that they don’t have a future.
What’s France’s excuse?
These French social institutions are designed with a purpose: to protect the French labor market’s “insiders.”
French political institutions also bear heavy responsibility.
Barriers to entry into the French political elite are exceptionally high.
The current president, Jacques Chirac, was elected 10 years ago; he was already in government in 1969.
France’s Identity Politics
In 2002, the priority was security.
Sarkozy, for example, proposes to establish a ministry of immigration and national identity.
For his part, the far-right leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, says that he is very happy with this evolution.
In this view, national identity, is a “spiritual concept” based on a common history and set of values.
One year after its implementation in March 2010, the reform has shown impressive results.
We will find out in the coming weeks whether the Cour de Cassation (Court of Final Appeal) will agree to refer the matter to the Council.
France’s Presidential Reality Show
That, at least, is how the system is supposed to work in theory.
On the left, Royal, the Socialist president of the region of Poitou-Charentes, has scant government experience, serving brief stints as environment minister, family minister, and education minister.
Ever since de Gaulle, all candidates for the French presidency who started too early have lost.
But those minor candidates underscore a deeper problem.
What we hear is idle speculation.
How did Royal rise so far and so fast?
As a political tactician, she has also been innovative, organizing her campaign on the Internet with a plan to write her program from the responses of users.
Last but not least, she is attractive.
Since 1981, no poll favorite has won the presidency.
But Royal is confident in her fate.
France’s Third Man
Why this paradox?
It would lead first to the end of the Socialist Party created by François Mitterrand.
France wants the illusion of change, but is continuity what she truly desires?.
France\u0027s Threat to European Unity
France Says “No” To Chirac, Not to Europe
In the period preceding the signing, however, French foreign minister Michel Barnier chastised him for lacking a “European reflex”.
The reason?
The market realizes this.
Free-Market Babies?
The fight this time would not be against British colonialism, but rather against the United Kingdom’s approach to regulating reproductive medicine.
It may come as a surprise to American observers, in particular, that the UK approach could be considered “free market.”
But the UK’s Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA) might not be around for much longer.
Of course, we now know that a diet of bully beef is likely to result in hardening of the arteries, whereas the vegetable-centered Mediterranean diet is much better for human health.
And here the plot has thickened.
What about the mere praise of “martyrs” who have died while murdering others?
When we in the West look outward, this remains our view.
France has made it illegal to deny any “internationally recognized crimes against humanity.”
Whereas in Muslim countries it is illegal to call the Armenian massacres of 1915-1917 “genocide,” in some Western countries it is illegal to say that they were not.
Legally protected history ensures that historians will play safe.
Independence for financial sector regulators is as important as independence for central banks, and for many of the same reasons.
Often, the independence of central banks and regulatory agencies exists only on paper.
Free Tilly – and all Circus Animals
Is it right to keep such large animals in close confinement?
Orcas are social mammals, and he would have been living with his mother and other relatives in a pod.
Several major cities and many local governments around the world do not permit circuses with wild animals.
Such enterprises are part of the commercial entertainment industry.
When our children ask us to take them to the circus, we should find out if the circus uses wild animals.
Free Trade, Free Labor, Free Growth
ADELAIDE – Protectionist sentiment and fear of globalization are on the rise.
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso believes that protectionist pressures are increasing. 
There would, of course, be costs.
In addition, there are social costs to consider.
Yet the benefits of a successful Doha round are between 45 and 440 times higher than these costs.
There are also one-off costs to host-country governments, such as processing applications and providing initial help with housing and welfare.
The benefits are between 28 and 220 times higher than the costs.
But big clustering effects are hard to find.
The economists Glenn Ellison and Edward Glaeser have found that clustering is only marginally greater than if businesses are allocated randomly.
Given these misconceptions, protectionism has re-emerged as a formidable foe.
Those who voted affirmatively were only a tiny minority.
They appeared taken aback.
I posed other hypotheticals, now directly related to international trade.
By hiring child workers in Indonesia?
Support for the proposed change dropped with each one of these alternatives.
So the students were not necessarily against redistribution.
They were against certain kinds of redistribution.
Too many economists are tone-deaf to such distinctions.
Establishing significantly freer trade would help the world combat almost all of its biggest problems.
Portugal could produce wine cheaply, whereas Great Britain could produce cloth much more cheaply than wine.
The panel – including five Nobel laureates – found that one of the single best actions the planet could take would be completing the Doha negotiations.
Instead of every closed market having to re-invent the wheel, once is enough to get everyone’s economy going.
There would, of course, be costs.
It is simply good.
Free Trade in an Age of Terror
The war on terror appears to be causing a surge in protectionism.
Some anti-terrorist warriors are so worked up about immigrants that they want to build a wall along the entire United States-Mexican border.
Bush may be right on guest workers, but his controversial proposal to have a Dubai-based company run six US ports is a big mistake.
Free traders are dismayed.
The American public understands this, even if their president does not.
Free traders should not be dismayed.
Consider pharmaceuticals.
If the whip is cracked in Tegucigalpa today, workers in Charlotte will feel it tomorrow.
The issue is not free trade versus protectionism, but “smart trade” versus “polarizing trade.”
DR-CAFTA does neither.
Free Trade with a Human Face
The same is true for much of Central America. And no part of South America is exempt from this pattern.
In this respect, the US could learn from the European Union.
Yet judgments about literary or artistic merit should not be the basis for decisions about freedom of expression.
Why this sharp change in tone?
Initially, this was not obvious to all.
Parliament was lively, but essentially powerless.
His Duma is much like the Duma of Nicholas II, docile and acquiescent.
His governors are also like Nicholas’s; many are governor-generals.
Of course, this does not mean that there is no difference between the Russia of Vladimir Putin and Nicholas Romanov.
Putin’s Russia is essentially about the Kremlin and the bureaucracy.
They are dominant, no doubt, but they are not Russia in its entirety.
The political gap can be narrowed only by indigenous capitalist development.
On September 15, 1999, the US Commission on National Security for the 21 st Century issued a report entitled ``New World Coming.''
Everyone agrees that others will follow.
Policymakers with the wisdom of Solomon, of whom there are precious few, are required.
It is a universal good that all must seek.
Many non-government organizations, both secular and religious, also opposed the resolution.
In the end, more Jewish settlements appear.
This pattern can be traced to 1967.
In fact, since the 1993 Oslo Accords the number of Jewish settlers in the occupied territories has doubled.
The Clinton administration attempted to put brakes on then-Prime Minister Netanyahu’s efforts to construct a new settlement near Bethlehem.
After a short hiatus, construction resumed.
Friedman Completed Keynes
The most famous and influential American economist of the past century died in November.
Milton Friedman was not the most famous and influential economist in the world -- that honor belongs to John Maynard Keynes.
But Milton Friedman ran a close second.
From one perspective, Milton Friedman was the star pupil of, successor to, and completer of Keynes’s work.
As Friedman said, “We are all Keynesians now.”
It was not a theory of prices.
Friedman, in a 30-year campaign starting with his and Anna J. Schwartz’s A Monetary History of the United States , restored the balance.
A relatively minor, technical difference in means, you might say.
And you would be half right.
Governments were inept.
The kinds of people who staffed governments were the kinds of people who liked ordering others around.
From “Les Bleus” to “the Blues”
PARIS – Is football (soccer) just a mirror that reflects the collective emotions of a country?
It would be tempting to attribute to football a “mapping” of the emotional state of the world.
There are many countries with social and economic conditions that are equal to or worse than France’s, yet their national teams are currently shining on the field.
And just think of Argentina.
But one should not confuse the consequence with the cause.
In reality, what applies to France can also be said of many other teams, such as Italy.
In 1998, France could celebrate the multicolor, multi-ethnic victory of “Les Bleus.”
Like the French army in the spring of 1940, the French team’s strategy and technique were outmoded.
Is France just an extreme version of Europe’s traditional “Big Powers” predicament?
In 2006, the World Cup final was European, with Italy defeating France.
From Cairo to California
In 1978, Proposition 13 capped California property taxes – the main source of public-school funding.
Egypt’s problems are, of course, vastly different from those of California.
People in both Cairo and California should look to East Asia.
Confucius, for example, said: “the man who uses his brain should govern; the man who uses his strength should be governed.”
For the moment, all this is still utopian.
From Central Bank to Central Planning?
A breakthrough came with the Italian Popular Party’s founding in 1919.
Maritain accepted the Pope’s verdict and began a remarkable ideological journey toward democracy.
But the point remains that ideas matter.
One way to do this is to understand China’s motives.
From Constitutional Crisis to European Crisis
The French “no” was a massive blow to the political credibility of French President Jacques Chirac.
From Copenhagen to Copenhagen
From "Copenhagen to Copenhagen" has thus been the motto of the Danish EU Presidency.
It is a challenge and an opportunity reaching beyond the present day.
The 20th century was a tragedy for Europe.
EU enlargement marks the beginning of a new era.
The expectations of the new Turkish government--and of the Turkish people--are high.
From de Gaulle to Putin
But pressure from the French army, and rebellion in Algeria, did not give Parliament much of a choice.
The ailing French republic’s political leaders hoped that de Gaulle could end the Algerian war, yet keep Algeria French.
De Gaulle’s agenda was very different: he wanted to rewrite the Constitution and to found a new “Fifth Republic” for France.
The alternative was an elected monarch: the Fifth Republic’s Constitution, ratified 50 years ago this week, was crafted around that central principle.
Only a king or an elected monarch could incarnate the national interest.
Democracy from a French perspective looks too American.
As de Gaulle wished, the French president has powers without equal in any other Western democracy.
Clinical depression affects roughly one in four people at some point in their lives.
The most commonly used treatment for major depression is antidepressant medication.
After a second or third episode, the risk of recurrence rises to 80-90%.
Research has shown that combining the ancient practice of meditation with modern psychotherapies can accomplish this.
From Financial Meltdown to Global Depression?
So we now have recession, a severe financial crisis, and a severe banking crisis in the advanced economies.
But even the better-performing ones – like Brazil, Russia, India, and China – are now at risk of a hard landing.
When the US Treasury announced a bailout of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in July, the rally lasted just four weeks.
This includes:
JAKARTA: Political crisis has replaced financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
What went wrong?
Nor are institutions the same as laws on paper.
The case of Korea is equally instructive.
From Football to Fascism in Russia
One group consisted of young people from the Northern Caucasus, the other of fans of a Moscow football (soccer) club.
One of the leaders of the Moscow fans, Yegor Sviridov, was murdered.
The crowd began to chant nationalist slogans, and then proceeded to beat up passersby who did not look Slavic.
The beatings continued and spread to the subway, where the police were essentially powerless.
The next day, back on Manezhnaya Square, beside the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a huge swastika appeared.
These events are not without precedent.
In 2002, Moscow authorities mounted huge TV-screens on Manezhnaya Square to broadcast a World Cup match between Russia and Japan.
It was decided to exploit the forthcoming world championship for “patriotic” purposes.
The government had erected the TV screens outside the Kremlin in order to ensure patriotic exultation of the victory that they assumed was coming.
No one was prepared for defeat.
Back then, the Kremlin was frightened by the possibility of a so-called “color revolution” breaking out in Russia.
This sort of manipulation is now a Kremlin staple.
That meeting was taking place as part of a gathering, led by Surkov, of Russian youth-movement activists.
STANFORD, CALIFORNIA – The current credit crisis has led to scaled-back projections for growth around the world.
But the automatic stabilizers that normally kick in did not.
From Great Game to Grand Bargain
LAHORE – The “Great Game” is no fun anymore.
Nineteenth-century British imperialists used that term to describe the British-Russian struggle for mastery in Afghanistan and Central Asia.
More than a century later, the game continues.
Building up Afghanistan’s security forces is at most a stopgap measure, as the country cannot sustain forces of the size that it now needs.
Such an initiative must include a comprehensive regional aid and development package.
This objective requires more than “pressuring” Pakistan.
But the Lisbon treaty has instead brought chaos to the Union.
What went wrong?
Many thought that this solidarity had been achieved in October 2004, with the signing of the Nice treaty, which outlined an EU constitution.
Faced with this situation, the European Council had only two choices. First, it could stick with the Nice treaty as the basis of the Union’s operation.
Over and above these considerable advances, the treaty aims to make the EU more democratic.
A final point worth emphasizing is that the Lisbon treaty moves away from many of the ideas that could serve as the foundations of a European federal super-state.
From Kafka to Gorbachev
But it does extend to what economists’ can know about human behavior and the market.
From Karl Popper to Karl Rove – and Back
Their distinguishing fea­ture is that they can be bought for money.
The separation of powers, free speech, and free elections alone cannot ensure open society; a strong commitment to the pursuit of truth is also required.
The most ef­fective techniques operate at the subconscious level.
But if the public is made aware of the various techniques, it is likely to reject them.
From Lady Di to Michelle Obama
These two phenomena are closely related.
In other words, Mrs. Obama is managing to set herself up, unprecedentedly, as the “people’s First Lady.”
So, what Michelle Obama is doing is not trivial.
Local cooking school students.
Local public high school students.
This is a guest list that says to an anxious electorate: I respect you, wherever you are on the socioeconomic scale.
It is far too large to be considered an elite.
It is not exclusively urban, and it includes people of different cultural origins.
But they are not.
Others looked at crimes against Palestinians in the wake of our self-defensive War of Independence.
Of course, extremists will hate it.
By contrast, moderates – all moderates – will accept it, albeit unhappily.
However, its weaknesses also became apparent during the mid- to late-1990’s.
But that leaves some large questions unresolved.
But is that a good thing?
From Oil to Information
For example, the classic 1972 bestseller Limits to Growth predicted that the world would run out of gold in 1981, silver and mercury in 1985, and zinc in 1990.
From Olympia to Impasse
PARIS – “Do not mix sports and politics!”
That defiant cry from China’s rulers to the threat of a boycott of this summer’s Beijing Olympic Games does not stand the test of reality.
Sport and politics have always been closely linked.
The 1936 Berlin Olympics were dominated as much by Nazi propaganda as by the athletic events.
During the Cold War, “ping pong diplomacy” helped revive official relations between China and the United States.
In 1990, Germany fielded a single Olympic team before the country reunified.
The Olympics were awarded to Beijing for a mixture of economic and political reasons, and China wanted the Games for the same reasons.
From Opportunity to Reality in the Middle East
It has been a long time since the words “opportunity” and “Middle East” appeared in the same sentence.
Arafat never grew beyond the man who appeared at the United Nations decades ago with both an olive branch and a gun.
Palestinians will need help if things are to turn out right in Gaza.
Here, too, there is an important role for America to play. In fact, the US has already begun to do what is required.
From Pain to Gain on the EU Frontier
But that acknowledgement of reality does not end the drama.
In the case of Greece and Portugal, for example, the tourism industry might absorb some unemployed retailers.
How long will the adjustment take?
The official recipe is “structural reform.”
What we are witnessing today is a totally different story.
For a majority of Russian citizens, economic prosperity and televised entertainment have become the modern equivalent of the panem et circenses formula of Roman times.
From Prague Spring to Velvet Revolution
WARSAW – What was the Prague Spring, or the events of 1968 more generally?
On the tenth anniversary of that invasion, Václav Havel, Jacek Kuron, and I, along with other dissidents, met on the Czech-Polish border.
These encounters were an extension of the climate of the Prague Spring.
In August 1989, I proposed in the Polish Diet a draft resolution apologizing to the Czechs and Slovaks for Polish involvement in the 1968 invasion.
Three months later, the Velvet Revolution began in Prague.
Finally, in a world divided by Yalta, communism was, for some, the only realistic choice for central Europe.
Attitudes towards communism were always a controversial subject for the anticommunist opposition.
These people, “tainted by communism,” constituted the majority of the participants in all revolts against the communist dictatorships.
From Red to Green?
They fail to recognize that if they do not reinvest their resource wealth into productive investments above ground, they are actually becoming poorer.
But the outcome is typically otherwise.
Companies will tell Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania, and Mozambique to act quickly, but there is good reason for them to move more deliberately.
They can be, but it will not happen on its own.
And it will not happen easily.
From Rome to Moscow
Will Pope Benedict XVI achieve the breakthrough that his friend and predecessor failed to realize?
At some level, of course, he is right.
There is no other way.
China is developing at a dizzying pace.
First and foremost, Solidarity was a cry of dignity.
Last winter, I saw a similar cry for dignity in Ukraine.
Something else is needed as well.
The society embraced by Solidarity counted 10 million members; indeed, 10 million real citizens.
Poland is a free country, a member of NATO and of the EU, while the Soviet Union is no more.
But recent history has not been kind to the victors.
Is this what normalcy always means?
Am I merely a veteran wistfully reminiscing about the old days of struggle?
Europe is equally responsible for advancing research on more secure technologies, particularly a fourth generation of nuclear-reactor technology.
If these plans are realized, the number of functioning reactors, currently 437, will double.
So expansion of nuclear energy is, and will continue to be, a fact.
But they should not be alone.
Disease-specific committees, called the Country Coordination Mechanism (CCM), are constituted in each developing country.
Once the program gets underway, the Global Fund follows the implementation of the program, undertaking audits, monitoring, and evaluation.
To peek into the future, all we have to do is go to Beijing, Athens, Tokyo, or, in fact, just about any city on Earth.
On a hot day in New York, locals sprawl out on the grass fields of Central Park, not on asphalt parking lots or concrete sidewalks.
Across an entire city, there’s much more tarmac than there is grass.
This effect, called an “urban heat island,” was discovered in London in the early 1800’s.
There are even more dramatic increases in Tokyo.
Looking at a fast-growing city like Houston, Texas, we can see the real effect of the urban heat island.
Over the last 12 years, Houston grew by 20%, or 300,000 inhabitants.
Simple solutions can make a vast difference to temperatures.
Cities are hotter than the land around them because they are drier.
They lack moist green spaces and have drainage systems that efficiently remove water.
In London, the air around the River Thames is cooler than it is a few blocks away in built-up areas.
Cities have a lot of black asphalt and dark, heat-absorbing structures.
Paint most of a city and you could lower the temperature by 10°C.
Consider Los Angeles.
That needs to change.
I have a suggestion.
That should get a conversation going!
Of course, there is the question of which movie to pick.
This year, the clear first choice has to be the 1963 James Bond spy thriller “From Russia with Love.”
Consider the dubious results from the G-8 summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, in 2005.
Don’t we all want to know how Bond (oops, I mean Sean Connery) would deal with Iran or North Korea?
To be sure, there could be glitches.
G-8 Summit and Climate Change
This year’s meeting, in Heiligendamm, Germany, must deliver on that promise.
Of this sum, only about half is readily identifiable.
MOSCOW – Vladimir Putin has finally done it.
But now the French seal of approval seemingly has been bestowed.
Two centuries after French troops were run out of Moscow in 1812, Putin has succeeded in making a French popular idol want to be Russian.
French artistic beauty is second to none.
Russia’s most famous museum, the Hermitage, is second only to the Louvre in its collection of French art.
Peter the Great, in his eighteenth-century effort to Westernize Russia, invited Jean-Baptiste Le Blond to become the chief architect of his new capital, St. Petersburg.
We love the French in general, but we adore him in particular. After all, he starred in the 2011 film about the life of the mad monk Grigory Rasputin.
Indeed, not long after Depardieu’s change of allegiance, a French icon of an even older vintage, Brigitte Bardot, suggested that she, too, might embrace Russia.
Gambler’s Ruin
Gambling with the Planet
But when it comes to the nuclear meltdown at Fukushima, there is a common theme in the two events.
Unfortunately, some of the really big risks that we face today are most likely not even rare events.
So much for unfettered capitalism!
In the end, those gambling in Las Vegas lose more than they gain.
As a society, we are gambling – with our big banks, with our nuclear power facilities, with our planet.
Well, it has not worked so far, and the already-sizeable stakes just got bigger.
Moreover, the potential impact certainly is not linear.
The killing of civilians has to stop, on both sides.
After all, more than 100 countries already recognized Palestine after Yasser Arafat declared the establishment of a state on November 15, 1988.
The Annapolis-inspired peace process received 81% support.
Like many territories in the region, Gaza has had a long history of foreign occupation, extending to ancient times.
The Palestinian Arab state envisioned by the United Nations’ 1947 partition plan, which was to include Gaza, was never established.
But, with the 1987 uprising (Intifada), Yasin’s supporters announced the creation of the Islamic Resistance Movement.
Gazelles and Turtles
The BRIC countries – Brazil, Russia, India, and China – are in the first group.
China remains the champion, with a growth rate around 10%.
Construction of new single-family homes in May 2010 was at its lowest point since this indicator’s introduction in 1963.
Commercial real-estate prices fell from May to June this year by an alarming 4%.
On the other hand, France, Europe’s second biggest economy, is struggling.
By contrast, countries that exported capital now enjoy an excess of liquidity because capital is shying away from “saturated” countries.
If government spends more – even if inefficiently – output goes up.
The same problems in making comparisons over time apply to comparisons across countries.
Any good measure of how well we are doing must also take account of sustainability.
His words are worth quoting at length:
Five other plaintiffs – along with major medical bodies – tell similar stories.
Is a genetic variant a “product of nature” or a “discovery”?
But what about a gene that has not left my body?
Don’t I somehow still “own” it?
Don’t I have rights of control over my own body?
Genetics\u0027 Information Revolution
Sequence data, whether from proteins or nucleic acids, are well suited to computer processing because they are easily digitized and broken down into their constituent units.
But advances in computing were indispensable to further progress.
Finally, in 1970 a splendid computer innovation enabled the proper alignment of amino acid sequences (which is vital to all subsequent data management). 
Occasionally, however, a slightly modified gene product proves adaptively advantageous, and a new protein is born.
Then, in 1978, DNA sequencing came into wide use.
And yet the interesting information resided in the  translated DNA sequences, that is, their protein equivalents. 
The human genome, they pointed out, contained a hundred times more amino acid sequences than the existing databases.
So how would the genes be identified?
How can you match up something that's never been found? 
Only a miniscule fraction of possible sequences has ever occurred, through duplication, multiplication, and modification of a small starter set of genes.
I was confident that bioinformatics would enable us to identify all genes merely by sequence inspection.
Even one of the most studied organisms,  E. coli , has an abundance of genes whose function has never been found. 
In the twin who developed the breast cancer, several hundred genes had been switched off.
The genes would then be passed down to descendants in this switched-off state.
One study of children in Bristol showed differences in growth depending on whether their grandfathers had smoked before the age of 11.
More than 40 other epigenetic drugs are being developed, not only for cancer, but also for obesity and even dementia.
Geneva on the Rhine
Germany was simply “too much” again.
It was only a matter of time, people thought, before the “German Question” would return to haunt Europe, as it did between 1871 and 1945.
Switzerland can be Switzerland because it is surrounded by the peaceful environment of the European Union.
The famous saying in Renaissance France, “What woman desires, God wants,” has become, “What the people desire, politicians will deliver.”
Yesterday, Europe was the solution for Germany; today, it is the problem.
BUDAPEST – Across Europe, millions are suffering from unemployment and the prospect of a long period of economic stagnation.
Together with the World Bank, we established the Roma Education Fund in 2005.
That is what the REF has done.
George W. Bush, International Anarchist
The parallel with Europe does not end there.
Like the ancient Greeks’ Hydra, Georgia’s political elite never ceases to die and be reborn.
Above all, Europe needs conviction.
Georgia Splits the Kremlin
Neither leader wants to capture Tbilisi.
German Reunification and the New Europe
October 3, 1990, was the effective date for the implementation of a stunning decision taken barely a month earlier.
France did not vote, so Great Britain and Denmark won by default.
Europe would take common action related to foreign affairs only on unanimous grounds.
It succeeded.
These new leaders envision Europe only as a trade regime.
Twenty years after reunification was completed, Germany has become one of the world’s great democracies.
But, of course, they do apply.
Instead of investing in discovering oil, Gazprom has become the biggest media group in Russia.
Russia’s leaders are entitled to the world’s understanding as they struggle to overcome generations of Soviet misrule.
Germany Is Not China
The world’s most populous country is the largest foreign creditor of the US government and government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Lumping all surplus countries together – or all deficit countries, for that matter, will not help us find a way to rebalance the world economy.
And the new mechanism will not be operative until September at the earliest.
Otherwise, the euro will break down.
Only Germany can reverse the dynamic of disintegration in Europe.
But Germany has no real choice.
It is here that Vosskuhle’s question matters the most.
What is dispiriting is that we ponder these arguments so infrequently.
But, if the eurozone is to be a sensible long-term proposition, mere survival is not enough.
His thin majority in the lower house of the Bundestag faces an upper house dominated by the opposition Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU).
Those days are over.
Germany is different, not because it is not spending now, but in how it talks about the future.
A second rationale for Germany’s policy is demographic.
There is obviously some element of bluff in legislating balanced budgets.
Germany’s Five Election Unknowns
Fortunately, politics is not mathematics – though, unfortunately, this means that there are no clear solutions.
The first unknown is why the election is taking place at all.
The second unknown concerns what, exactly, separates the major parties in this contest.
Who will make Germany an engine of Europe again rather than a gloomy passenger?
But it remains to be seen whether, or when, that might be on offer.
From 1995 to 2005, Germany will have grown by only 14.6%, while the old EU on average will have grown by 24%, the US by 39.9%, and the world economy by 45.6%.
But this theory is not convincing.
German precision instruments and optical equipment, for example, lost their competitive edge when Japan entered the game.
The second shock was EU integration, including the northern and southern enlargements.
But this helped Europe’s small countries more than the big ones, and it implied more competition for Germany, Europe’s biggest economy.
Think of Nokia, the mobile phone maker.
All five shocks constitute historical developments that are good for the world as a whole, but problematic for Germany.
Germany, by contrast, is a mainstay of the democratic world.
Reserve holdings of dollar assets (primarily by central banks) were worth around 2% of US GDP in 1948 and about the same in 1968.
When you sell more to the world than you buy, you accumulate claims on the rest of the world – and you need to decide the form in which you want to hold those claims.
Germany’s Neighborhood Watch
FRANKFURT – On a recent trip to Germany, I was struck by two distinct narratives.
Both narratives are understandable.
Either the neighborhood improves, or the value of the house declines.
And it matters a great deal which narrative prevails – for Germany, for Europe, and for the global economy.
In other words, it is the AAA of AAAs.
Yet Germany is also part of a highly challenged neighborhood, if not its anchor.
Moreover, to maximize their effectiveness, they must be implemented simultaneously; indeed, this is a situation in which one plus one plus one equals more than three.
I know that many Germans are uncomfortable with this.
Ultimately, there can be no strong Germany without a stable eurozone; no stable eurozone without a strong Germany; and no global economic stability without both.
Germany’s Pathological Export Boom
From 1995 to 2004, Germany lost a total of 1.09 million full-time equivalent jobs in manufacturing and trade.
But even western Germany holds the second-lowest rank of all developed countries.
The automobile and electrical engineering industries have been at the forefront of the bazaar economy.
Germany’s Sunshine Daydream
And, while sunlight is free, panels and installation are not.
The country is then forced to import considerable amounts of electricity from nuclear power plants in France and the Czech Republic.
Indeed, despite the massive investment, solar power accounts for only about 0.3% of Germany’s total energy.
Using solar, Germany is paying about $1,000 per ton of CO2 reduced.
Germany could have cut 131 times as much CO2 for the same price.
The 8th of May always brings back memories of 1945, because for me the end of the war in Europe really was a zero hour.
My father who had been in the resistance would come back from Brandenburg prison.
I no longer needed to hide as I had done after my release from a Gestapo camp at the beginning of February.
First, however, was the chaos.
The occupation troops went on a rampage.
Food was hard to find.
Was it defeat or liberation?
For Germans this question was not easily answered, though clearly our family was liberated in every sense.
Where do we go from here?
“You must help,” my mother said to me.
So I offered my services to the local Soviet authority and helped distribute basic foodstuffs to a small number of outlets in our district of Zehlendorf.
Five weeks later, however, I was back at school.
In the Soviet zone of occupation, progress was slow and above all coupled with a new enslavement.
Within a year of the end of the war there were indigenous administrations, within two years elections.
Two of these deserve to be mentioned.
One is economic and has to do with the Marshall Plan.
This is where the Marshall Plan of American support became crucial.
The Nuremberg trials exposed the guilt of the Nazi leaders beyond doubt, if indeed any such doubt was left in people’s minds.
Germany’s Nazi past is uniquely horrible, so comparisons with other countries with blighted histories are misleading.
In Europe then, the 8th of May 2005 is an occasion to look back in sorrow and anger.
Germany versus the Euro
Here is a fight over the single most successful monetary-policy measure of recent decades – not just in Europe, but anywhere.
Moreover, an increasing number of Germans, openly or secretly, want to have the Deutschemark back.
A deep European depression would result, almost certainly dragging down the German economy and reversing the European integration process.
There is only one sensible way forward.
Both episodes were seen as a form of corruption: one involved money, the other deception.
In other words, the acquaintances and benefactors of the East Asian leaders were “cronies,” whereas those of US leaders were “friends”?
The same is true in a few other areas, such as education policy and telecom regulation.
What works in one setting is unlikely to work in another.
Good governance is good in and of itself.
I blame two unsolved, but solvable, problems.
More than most places, Latin America was born in violent conquest.
Europeans subdued Amerindian populations and also brought in massive numbers of slaves from Africa, especially to the Caribbean basin and Brazil.
Asian developing countries are now producers of computers, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and software.
Such a push could play a major role in jump-starting economic growth.
Getting Over the Irish Stew
Had the Iraq venture been more successful, these worries would have been justified.
There is little secret that there were discussions concerning Iran.
The tragic result has been extremely low use of nets throughout most of Africa, since impoverished people lack the purchasing power to buy nets.
The pharmaceutical industry, led by Novartis, has been way ahead of donor agencies. Novartis has agreed to make these medicines available at the cost of production.
What will this require?
Similarly, Guyana will have its debt reduced by more than 8% of GDP.
The result of all this is spreading hopelessness.
In the last four years, radical Islam has established itself in the Northern Caucasus.
This doesn't mean that all local Muslims have become jihadis.
In fact, the latter are a tiny minority.
The fight against terror turns on who will strike first; so far, the terrorists have been faster and more professional than the Russian state.
Yet nothing has been done to root out this tool of terror.
The Kremlin must know this already.
Even Putin's predictable presidential rhetoric reveals a desire to initiate a real fight against terrorism.
Russia’s diplomats have generally, but not always, adopted a harder line, while Rogozin has been pushing his own BMD agenda.
Many Russians still employ negative and outdated Cold War constructs when discussing Russia-US nuclear relations.
In that case, productive collaboration on other issues might become easier.
It was impossible to short the lira or the franc because there were no more lire or francs.
But Italy and France had to give something in return for this security: the ECB was made independent of all eurozone governments.
To rule this out, “unlimited interventions” would be needed.
And the Bundestag (not Standard and Poor’s) would have to be happy.
Getting to Yes With Iran
After a time, they are removed, and a new set of representatives is dispatched.
His clear priority is the Islamic Republic’s survival, not the fate of particular Iranian politicians.
Among my various identities that day, that of driver was the most obvious to her.
But you cannot dress up failure in the clothes of success.
Sen says that what is being accepted here should be thought of as national identity.
It is an identity we share by living together and by what we have in common, whatever the differences between our multiples identities.
There can be common ground between these two positions, particularly with respect to primary schools.
Specifically, children are more attentive to classroom tasks after recess than before recess.
On randomly assigned days, the children went out to recess at 10 a.m. or at 10:30 a.m.
In all the experiments, the children were more attentive after the recess than before, and they were less attentive when the break came later.
In Brazil, the government is daring, for the first time, to address the lawlessness of the overcrowded favelas that ring the country’s large cities.
The Cold War distorted that wisdom.
Now it is roughly 0.25% of GNP.
Six more countries, all in Europe, have recently set a timetable to reach 0.7% of GNP by the year 2015.
They are Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
But there is a limit to greed.
There is a path to sustained recovery, but it is narrowing.
This is especially important for the young.
That hasn’t happened yet.
The fourth policy imperative is rebuilding.
But we need to act quickly – and together.
The Bank of England is buying UK government bonds (“gilts”).
Nor did American government spending end the Great Depression (unemployment was still over 15% in 1939, a decade after the depression’s onset).
(In practice, it is an experiment.)
But the rise of interactive social networking has made financial innovation more bottom-up.
Innovation in the last century focused on processes, products, and services.
Global imbalances were, to be sure, smaller overall than before the crisis, but they did not disappear.
In China, net exports and strong government-supported investment ensured continuous expansion.
I am not advocating a return to the early Middle Ages, when Church usury laws forbade interest on loans.
Global Macroeconomic Cooperation
The worldwide financial bubble cannot and should not be recreated.
Global Risk and Reward in 2011
The damage from the financial crisis is still ongoing, but stronger growth can heal many wounds, especially debt-driven wounds.
So far, the downside and upside risks for the world economy are balanced.
But technology’s impact does not stop there.
Proximity still matters in terms of transport and logistics costs.
Adjacency is no longer a requirement.
And stories abound of global warming bringing malaria to Europe or Vermont.
So, as warming increases, we will see “shockingly high prices” for pasta and bread.
But increasing temperatures will harm some crops while benefiting others.
And, as growing wheat and grains becomes possible higher north in Canada and Russia, even more opportunities will open up.
What could be achieved by planting more trees, cutting methane, or reducing black soot emissions?
Our choices will result in different outcomes and different costs.
The optimal combination of solutions will create the biggest impact for the least money.
A groundbreaking paper by economists Eric Bickel and Lee Lane is one of the first – and certainly the most comprehensive – study of the costs and benefits of climate engineering.
Deliberately manipulating the earth’s climate seems like something from science fiction.
Climate engineering has the advantage of speed.
Many methods of atmospheric engineering have been proposed.
Reflecting just 1-2% of the total sunlight that strikes the earth could offset as much warming as that caused by doubling preindustrial levels of greenhouse gases.
This augments the natural process, where sea salt from the oceans provides water vapor with the cloud condensation nuclei.
Many of the risks of climate engineering have been overstated.
This is startling, given the manifold benefits.
Climate engineering could remain a back-up option in case of necessity.
In dispatches from the Pacific Islands, Bangladesh, or Ethiopia, journalists warn of impending calamity.
Its resolution is vital.
He has lost count of how many times he has contracted the disease.
Our researcher accompanies him to a free clinic.
The electricity is not working.
Michel is not Desi’s biological child.
It is rife here.
There are no roads, electricity, or other infrastructure.
For $286 million, we could get iron and iodine to more than 2.5 billion people.
Indeed, for every dollar spent on strong climate policies, we will likely do about $0.02 of good for the future.
She says that the snow and ice have been melting.
But we need to pay as much attention to the people living in the mountain’s shadow.
COPENHAGEN – Our current approach to solving global warming will not work.
And even if you disagree on both counts, the current approach is also flawed technologically.
We are not taking this challenge seriously.
We need many, many times more non-carbon-based energy than is currently produced.
In many cases, there is still a need for the most basic research and development.
That is the wrong question.
In other words, we will all be worse off.
Well, it’s technically true that there is a link between the chemicals and illness, but the risk is miniscule in any well-regulated country.
There is another threat that you haven’t been told much about.
One of the best ways to avoid cancer is to eat lots of fruit and vegetables.
Well, then, let’s do the math.
Looking at the best-studied polar bear population of 1,000 bears, in the West Hudson Bay, how many polar bears would we save in a year?
Ten?
Twenty?
A hundred?
Each year, 49 bears are shot in the West Hudson Bay alone.
Much of my work is to make sense of all these global warnings.
Global average life expectancy in 1900 was 30 years; today, it is 68 years.
I believe that such views lack historical perspective.
More fundamentally, the image of a homogenizing America reflects a mistakenly static view of culture.
For example, many more countries turned to Canada than to America as an example for framing constitutions in the aftermath of the Cold War.
American environmental attitudes toward climate change or genetic modification of food bring similar criticism.
The use of the Welsh language in Britain and Gaelic in Ireland is greater today than fifty years ago.
At the same time, immigrants, ideas, and events outside America's borders are changing American culture within the borders of the US.
Of course, the concert ended in cacophony with the outbreak of World War I in the summer of 1914.
Can something like the Concert of Europe be globalized?
Fragmentation also affects societies internally.
It is “easier to get, harder to use – and easier to lose.”
Globalization and Its Discontents in 2004
"Shock therapy" is a strategy that has repeatedly failed.
For the first time, developing countries united, and the talks broke down.
The counterpart of America's immense fiscal deficit is its yawning trade gap.
Globalization and the Beautiful Game
Arsenal, which currently leads the English Premier League, fields 11 starters who typically do not include a single British player.
But soccer enthusiasts care about country as well as club, and here the consequences of the global mobility of talent are not as straightforward.
England once again provides an apt illustration.
There is also a broader backlash under way.
The 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, held in Ghana during January and February, revealed the two-way interdependence that soccer globalization has created.
But the most important lesson revealed by the Africa Cup is that successful nations are those that combine globalization’s opportunities with strong domestic foundations.
Globalization and the Genoa Summit
Globalization and the United Nations
Third, more than 140 nations agreed in Doha, Qatar to launch a new round of trade negotiations.
Importantly, developing countries achieved several breakthroughs in the new trade agenda.
No country wants to be outside of this global process.
It cannot be a game of rich against poor.
It cannot function without international law and international institutions.
The fear of globalization in the West is nothing new.
What happened next was what I have called an “ironic reversal.”
In other words, Kipling could yet be proved wrong.
Globalization’s Assassin
Likewise, hundreds, if not thousands, of Africans die every year trying to reach the shores of Fortress Europe.
Even the gap between Greece and Albania, at three to one, was narrower than it is now.
The world’s most successful economies today are in Scandinavia.
Globalizing NATO
NATO faced off against the Warsaw Pact, created by the Soviet Union and its allies in 1955.
Finally, Pacific partners include Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and Mongolia.
NATO is no longer just a hammer; it is an entire toolbox of security options.
OXFORD – Where does America put God?
Even civilized, educated people signed on to it.
It was not the US that was gripped by this wave of racist paranoia, but France, the cradle of “liberté, egalité et fraternité.”
Godless Morality
Indeed, atheists and agnostics do not behave less morally than religious believers, even if their virtuous acts rest on different principles.
Perhaps a divine creator handed us these universal elements at the moment of creation.
Consider the following three scenarios.
If you pick up the child, she will survive and your pants will be ruined.
These intuitions reflect the outcome of millions of years in which our ancestors have lived as social mammals, and are part of our common inheritance.
What was good for our ancestors may not be good today.
Going “Soft” on Iran
Going to the Dogs
GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA – There are about 70 million dogs living in human homes in the United States.
That’s 10 million more dogs than children under the age of 15.
The pattern in other Western nations is similar.
And yet attempts to view canine smarts as cut from the same cloth as human intelligence gloss over a lot of the details about how dogs and humans operate.
Recent research by Alexandra Horowitz at Barnard College in New York accentuates the “talking past each other” that sometimes goes on between humans and dogs.
The twist in this tale is that only half of the owners were correctly informed.
Gone with the Wind
In fact, this is a highly problematic claim.
At the same time, people increasingly protest against the wind farms in their backyards.
Making up for a 5% shortfall in supply is manageable, but the situation will change dramatically as the UK increases its reliance on wind power to reach the 31% target by 2020.
In other words, temperature rises would be postponed by a mere 66 hours by the end of the century.
Likewise, the UK Energy Research Center laments that wind-power costs have “risen significantly since the mid-2000’s.”
PARIS – The reality of market exchange – direct transactions between merchants and customers – appeared gradually 3,000 or 4,000 years ago.
It remains dominant today, as all efforts to establish an alternative, even totalitarianism, failed.
By the time of the French Revolution, the standard of living had hardly doubled since the Roman Empire.
Today, it is 150 times higher.
It was a form of slavery.
It brought Adolf Hitler to power, leading to a war that left 50 million dead.
Otherwise, we can expect a long period of stagnation, punctuated by periodic financial crises.
Not so, replies strategic investment analyst H. Wood Brock in an interesting new book, The American Gridlock.
(I have proposed a similar institution in the United Kingdom.)
As Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations:
Good Capitalism, Bad Capitalism
We find it useful to divide the capitalist economies into four broad categories.
Such a tendency contributed significantly to the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98.
Good Governance Begins At Home
This is something for Wolfowitz’s successor to bear in mind.
These efforts have been matched by actions in the poorest countries.
The rich world has promised to help Mali, and now Mali has led the way with its creativity. 
The European Union has launched a €1 billion effort to help peasant farmers.
Goodbye and Hello to the Universal Bank
In 2001, for instance, Le Monde contained more than 3,500 references to mondialisation.
But then the figure steadily fell – more than 80% by 2006.
Today, few know where the term “globalization” originated.
The word had been used earlier, but in a rather different sense.
Since then, the term has had ups and downs.
The terms that we use to describe complex political and social phenomena and processes have odd ambiguities.
Some concepts that are designed as criticisms are quickly inverted to become celebratory.
The idea was to keep the meeting small and informal by limiting it to a number that could fit into the library of the chateau at Rambouillet.
Later, Russia was added to make it the “G-8.”
Leaders’ time is a scarce resource.
They cannot afford to attend multiple summits for each transnational issue.
With a larger group, real discussion is lost; with a smaller group, meaningful regional representation is difficult.
Perhaps leaders should be limited to one aide in the room and prohibited from reading formally prepared opening statements.
You can’t treat your customers as badly as the United States has done lately if they can go elsewhere.
Ultra-rich sovereign wealth funds have the cash to rescue US banks.
The Yuan may well supplant the dollar in the second half of this century.
Moreover, international investors can buy and sell real estate far more easily in the US than in most of Europe.
But the euro does have growing strengths.
The British pound only forfeited its role to the US dollar after more than 50 years of industrial decline and two world wars.
Putting Education First
But were the traders and bankers of the sub-prime saga more greedy, arrogant, and immoral than the Gekkos of the 1980’s?
Government Accountability or Government Accounting?
But he should have.
So, should the French be worried?
Eventually, the voters will have the final say.
Governments Without Opposition
The phenomenon is by no means confined to what once was the political right.
It is difficult to trip them up by offering alternative policies in any field.
This disquiet is expressed in several ways.
Another takes the form of "opposition by media."
The result is a worrying combination of creeping authoritarianism among those who rule with a growing unrest of the ruled.
As so often the case, there is no patent medicine against this syndrome.
Governments without opposition pose a threat to democracy itself.
At the time, Kasparov dominated world chess, in the same way that Tiger Woods – at least until recently – has dominated golf.
Deep Blue shocked the champion, winning the match 3.5 to 2.5.
Many commentators have labeled Deep Blue’s triumph one of the most important events of the twentieth century.
I sure can’t.
Only a machine can consistently tell what another computer would do in a given position.
In short, I do not share the view of many that, after the Internet and the personal computer, it will be a long wait until the next paradigm-shifting innovation.
Certainly, this scenario is at odds with the Chinese Communist Party.
Numerous towns have attempted to follow with elections of their own of this type.
Grassroots democracy may be momentarily suppressed, but once the seeds have been planted, the roots can only grow deeper and deeper before an inevitable bloom.
But it will be much more difficult to persuade China that it should stand down.
The same can be said for China’s growing stridency with respect to its claims in the South China Sea.
Making good on its claim to the South China Sea could be next.
Of course, the process would be traumatic – and not just for Greece.
Yet these problems can be overcome.
Greece’s Catharsis?
In the 1990’s, in the run-up to joining the eurozone, Greece achieved substantial gains on this front.
High growth rates were achieved in conditions of stability.
The welfare state was transformed into a system of endemic waste.
We can have at most two at one time.
The classic case is Britain’s short-lived return to gold in the interwar period.
The architects of the Bretton Woods regime kept this lesson in mind when they redesigned the world’s monetary system in 1944.
The loss in national sovereignty is then compensated by the “internationalization” of democratic politics.
Think of this as a global version of federalism.
But it does not have automatic access to a European lender of last resort.
Green Bootleggers and Baptists
Businesses see opportunities for taxpayer-funded subsidies, and to pass on inevitable cost growth to consumers.
Green Domestic Product?
In fact, doing so could be a serious mistake.
For example, if the wetland were to be destroyed to make way for a new district, we know that its benefits would have to be at least $1.75 million higher than the costs.
The swamp is close to the city center and its industrial center, and there is a land shortage in Kampala.
Much of lower Manhattan would still be a swamp, rather than being turned into the powerhouse of New York City, at a huge cost to society.
Green Money
Green Shoots or Yellow Weeds?
This, too, helps European growth.
Grit is Good
There is more grit on the horizon.
Turnover in US financial markets rose four-fold in the decade before the crisis.
The rapid, dramatic shifts brought about by HFT are likely to continue.
Grounding Syria’s Killers
For one thing, it would be impossible to do so under the auspices of the United Nations, owing to Russian and Chinese obstructionism in the Security Council.
Grow Your Own Silicon Valley
Many countries, indeed, are envious of Silicon Valley outside of San Francisco, the world's center of the computer, software, and Internet industries.
Silicon Valley is loaded with startup companies, and with former startups like Intel and Cisco Systems that grew very big, very fast.
A large pool of engineers, scientists, and software experts are available to both new and old companies.
Silicon Valley clearly grew over time with little help from government.
Growing Up in the Eurozone
The sizeable investments required to make up for the loss of nuclear energy may contribute more immediate stimulus.
Growth in a Buddhist Economy
The second was about the individual and the meaning of happiness.
Thinley put it simply: We are each finite and fragile physical beings.
Bhutan has many things going its way.
Bhutan has embarked on such a serious journey.
I went to university myself in 1962.
Those were the days when global peace was sustained by a concept known suitably enough by the acronym MAD – Mutually Assured Destruction.
At the end of my years at Oxford, I went as a student to the United States and visited Alabama.
Nothing to be grumpy about there.
But – and here comes the real hit – carbon-dioxide emissions grew seventeen-fold.
Let me explain.
Try telling that to the poor.
I have five grandchildren below the age of four.
How much will they have to get angry about then because of the way that we are behaving today?
Guatemala\u0027s Candidate from Hell
The indictment describes brutal crimes--mass murders, rapes, and the dislocation of hundreds of thousands of people--carried out systematically in the Guatemalan highlands.
In San Martín Jilotepeque, villagers were rounded up by Guatemala's military, forced to cook for soldiers and dig pits in the earth.
Later, their masters shot and then dumped them into the pits.
Guatemala's press has taken a hostile position against the former general.
Meanwhile, all over Guatemala, thousands of communities are seeking to exhume the graves of the massacred.
Guilty Democrats
Such abasement will only lead people to begin to doubt whether democracy is a living social system.
That is a false choice.
In the case of Iraq, there was particular fear of chemical and biological weapons.
Mixed motives are not necessarily bad motives.
In fact, most human motives are mixed.
The Allies defended those to whom they were bound by treaty, and then the integrity of their own countries.
Democratic manners came more naturally to the British occupation forces.
The second example, the end of the Cold War in 1989, was also a success story.
Evidently, differences of culture and circumstances abound.
Democracy is by definition a peaceful method of settling conflicts.
In fact, the two belong together.
On the other hand, hard power without soft power means only destruction.
Where such capacity exists, there would also be recognition of the fact that democracy does not mean the same institutions in all cultural contexts.
In fact, Europe’s failure is not just a shame, but a historic calamity.
What a difference today’s crisis has made.
Economists who focus on such issues tend to fall into three groups.
Given that the US is undergoing economic hard times, the size of the response has surprised many.
But the response has been worldwide.
In Melbourne for the Australian Open, Roger Federer, Serena Williams, and other stars held an exhibition match that led to donations of $600,000.
The earthquake killed up to 200,000 people.
That epidemic has spread to all ten departments of the country, as well as to the capital, Port au Prince.
Clearly, the epidemic will continue to spread.
While the epidemiological statistics are alarming, the death rate has declined in recent weeks, from 7.6% to 3.6%.
The reason: we are there with what is required – medical aid, sanitation, and clean water.
Political leaders must put the national interest ahead of personal and partisan ambitions.
Hamas, Fatah, and the Palestinian Dilemma
GAZA CITY – With dueling authorities running Gaza and the West Bank, the Palestinian people find themselves in the middle of an experiment.
As a result, Palestinians face their most difficult challenge since 1948. 
Only recently have these been rebuilt.
Hamas and Fatah at the Crossroads
Since Hamas was founded in the early 1980’s, it has refused to come under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
Hamas Comes in from the Cold
But Mashal’s refusal to support Assad has not only forced him to re-locate.
As in Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia, Islamist moderates in the Palestinian territories need to be engaged as a legitimate political force.
That means supporting the ongoing effort to form an interim Palestinian government of technocrats, as stipulated in the Qatar agreement.
Palestine is not yet a state, but it is already a failed one.
Hamas’s Ghost in Annapolis
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice’s efforts to push the peace process forward during her last years in office seem genuine.
But can the Middle East conference set to take place in Annapolis, Maryland succeed?
Even the Palestinian Authority (PA) blames Hamas for the fighting.
In return, the PA has been repressing Hamas in the West Bank.
These two problems pose far greater dangers to the existing states than does any (largely fabricated) Israeli threat, and the region’s rulers know it.
Police are unavailable.
You pull out your far superior gun.
In an abstract sense, this is what Israel is doing right now.
After all, Israel is the strong guy, the former occupying power, the better shooter.
Its bombardment of Gaza is not “proportional.”
Indeed, there is no symmetry of suffering on the two sides of the border.
Does it trump the real, if less bloody, agony and fear of hundreds of thousands Israelis over long years?
To the detriment of their own people, its leaders, Haled Mash'al and Ismail Hanieh, want neither peace nor compromise.
It is as simple as that.
Hamas Takes on the Radicals
The Army of Islam joined in the raid that abducted the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in June 2006.
Their Web site shares images, language, and music with al-Qaeda and other jihadi groups.
In a recent declaration, the group made favorable mention of al-Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri.
Hands Off the \
The Euro's exchange rate has since endured a roller-coaster ride.
Now, it has returned to almost exactly its opening level.
So why is the European business community claiming that the "super Euro" is bringing calamity down upon their heads?
That conclusion still applies.
It was innovation, and high productivity, not a weak currency, that enabled German and Japanese goods to conquer the world.
Europe's economic policymakers have enough problems on their plate.
Americans are richer than they were in the 1950’s, but they are not happier.
The Beatles reminded us that money can’t buy us love.
We evolved from beings who had to work hard to feed themselves, find a mate, and raise children.
Since he is an agnostic, his gift is not motivated by any belief that it will benefit him in an afterlife.
Why is the economic mood so negative?
The answer lies in the definition of a recession.
In economics, one has to run to stand still.
One of the marvels of a market economy is how, every year, year after year, productivity--the amount of output produced by each worker in an hour--increases.
But with productivity now back up to the levels of the 1960's, the economy's annual growth potential increased from around 2.5% to around 3.5%.
After all, there is nothing magic about the number zero.
Hard Financial Questions about Soft Development Money
The first key factor is deleveraging and the resulting shortfall in aggregate demand.
Hard Turkey
It could be a bridge between the West and the East, between Islam and modernity, and between Israel and the Arabs.
Revealingly, the writer Miranda Seymour’s recently published book Noble Endeavours reminds Britain of the centuries-old love affair between Germany and England.
Maybe the royal family will go back to styling itself the House of Hanover?
The 1648 Peace of Westphalia reduced the number of independent units in the Holy Roman Empire from 3,000-4,000 to 300-400.
In the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars, the number of German states fell to 39. By 1866, only 34 members of the German confederation remained.
While Germany’s 1949 split into the Federal Republic and the Democratic Republic raised the number to four (along with Austria and Switzerland), the overall trajectory has been clear.
Seed is also transformed in this way from being a renewable regenerative resource into a non-renewable resource and commodity.
The farm suicides first started in the district of Warangal in Andhra Pradesh.
For farmers, it translates into suicide.
Technologies are tools.
When the tool fails, it needs to be replaced.
It is time to stop the killing.
Harvests of Hunger
Has America Lost its Mojo?
The basic elements of a recovery package include, first and foremost, a rational approach to rebooting the financial system.
But, as in wartime, one hopes these effects are temporary.
Britain, Ireland, and Spain each face financial crises of a similar magnitude.
Military power, which some call the ultimate form of power in world politics, requires a thriving economy.
A carrot is more effective than a stick if you wish to lead a mule to water, but a gun may be more useful if your aim is to deprive an opponent of his mule.
Their suggestion was not heeded.
Think of the scaffolding and equipment around construction sites.
The consensus is that they do not.
And it is this liquidity and quality of information that ultimately propels economic growth.
Next year, Mexico’s real exports will be five times what they were in 1990.
Without this guarantee, fewer would have invested in the capacity to satisfy the US market.
All these factors lend credence to the view that oil production has peaked.
Indeed, given the difficulty in estimating the total size of resources, many consider peak oil theories irrelevant.
Unfortunately, that debate has not yet started.
Has Palestine Won?
Unlike Israel’s peace with Egypt (and, one hopes, its peace with Syria), the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is rooted in more than a real-estate dispute.
But don’t hold your breath.
Nothing will come out of the Quartet’s move unless the parties change their attitudes.
Has Russia Gone Back to Sleep?
MOSCOW – In just six months, from the end of September 2011 to March 2012, Russia was transformed.
The protests’ leaders could formulate no new goals and slogans.
To many, the protest movement had been defeated.
Russian society has become a dry peat bog, waiting for a spark to ignite it.
But what is happening in Russian society is more important.
And Moscow is not the only example.
Likewise, home prices declined at a very rapid rate of 18.7% in the 12 months to March, which is not meaningfully lower than the 19% fall over the 12 months to February.
And the most recent monthly decline corresponded to an annual rate of more than 25%.
In contrast, salaries, self-employment income, dividends, and interest all fell.
This was confirmed by a fall in retail sales in April.
Healing Bolivia
A referendum on autonomy which was approved in May in Bolivia’s eastern province of Santa Cruz has generated fear about the region’s eventual secession.
The most outspoken anti-government forces in Santa Cruz seem to be itching for partition.
But can Bolivia move away from becoming a quasi-failed state?
With a reformist regime in La Paz, it is difficult not to expect tensions with the Bush administration.
Healing the Depressed Brain
Depression thus leads to changes in the rest of the body, owing to long-term chemical imbalances in the systems that control the heart, the immune system, and metabolism.
Lithium, a mood stabilizer and neuroprotective agent, has the properties we are seeking, although its toxicity makes it less than ideal.
As ever, the challenge facing medical researchers is to develop more effective treatments without reducing their safety.
Different health conditions impede development in characteristic ways.
HIV/AIDS for example, destroys the lives of workers in their most productive years and orphans millions of children.
NEW YORK – For those of you who have seen the (American) movie “Up in the Air,” think of the scene where George Clooney meets Vera Farmiga.
How do you translate healthy behavior into status?
MedRewards is not alone.
For example, Alice could fill in the blanks: “I will walk three extra miles if @JuanTigar spends 30 minutes on the elliptical machine.”
Like many people, I thought that small, innovative companies dominated functional foods.
Others are so highly fortified with vitamin A or D that ConsumerLab advises against giving them to young children.
I agree.
If I need a hundred or so calories in a hurry, I prefer a banana, a handful of nuts, or, for that matter, a delicious candy bar.
Real health foods do not need to be made functional to be good for you.
They are functional just the way they are.
Each city is ultimately a special case.
They are also likely to be hardest hit by natural disasters, such as the floods and mudslides that devastated parts of Rio de Janeiro in January.
Fewer still have addressed the need for vertical coordination betweennational and city governments.
You are in a crowd when you hear your name.
You turn, looking for the speaker.
This experience prompted his writing the  Duino Elegies . 
Not so for the person with mental illness.
Without treatment, these experiences recur relentlessly. 
We are pursuing three intertwined ideas.
It is as if the string section of the orchestra suddenly decided to play its own music, disregarding everyone else. 
An example is Charles Bonnet Syndrome, where visual impairments in the elderly can produce visions of human figures.
PHILADELPHIA – Imagine that you are shopping for a high-performance car, but that you are not allowed to look under the hood.
What’s inside is a secret.
Furthermore, you cannot find out how similar vehicles have performed, because there are none.
Finally, the car carries no warranty.
Enter Oz, who holds a doctorate in physics.
He has no investment talent, but he knows about probabilities, and is running a hedge fund worth $100 million.
At the end of the year, the probability is 90% that the event does not occur, so Oz owes nothing to option holders.
This poses real challenges for regulators.
Alternatively, managers could guarantee limits on losses, similar to a car manufacturer’s warranty.
Asia is the major beneficiary, receiving $113 billion.
Restrictive legal rules in some countries exclude migrants from using official banking systems unless they have the necessary legal status.
Other countries, however, have taken steps to make remittance transfers possible via mobile phones.
Henry Paulson is Wrong
But we are in extraordinary times, and the government has taken and is prepared to take unprecedented measures.
But at what price?
But, again, at what price?
How is that possible?
For six of the last 13 years, the Treasury Secretary was a Goldman Sachs alumnus.
Do we want to live in a system where profits are private, but losses are socialized, where taxpayer money is used to prop up failed firms?
Herbert Hoover and the Stability Pact
The reduction in tax collection can increase disposable income.
But it is dangerous to become obsessed with the past.
What, then, was the rationale for adding so many in 1980?
Incredibly, the lists of symptoms for some disorders were knocked out in minutes.
Good fences make good neighbors, so the poet Robert Frost wrote.
But support for enlargement is fading everywhere, right on the brink of accession. 
The root of this fear, of course, is the vast differences in income between citizens of, say, Lithuania, and those of most of the Union.
Economic and financial transmission lines cannot be rerouted quickly.
Think of a car that can and should achieve great performance based on its strong internal engine.
Do they intend to give foreign athletes paper bags stuffed with dollars as a welcoming present at the Olympic village?)
High Tensions In the Low Countries
Clearly, a system of one vote per member state would have meant domination by Europe’s smaller states.
The Benelux economy is the EU’s fourth largest.
Traditionally, the Netherlands has thought of itself as the smallest of the EU’s large member states.
But others generally see it as the largest of the small.
Since that exceeds the size of the government deficit, it implies that private markets do not need to buy any of the newly issued government debt.
TOKYO – F. Scott Fitzgerald famously said that “there are no second acts in American lives.”
Clinton’s four years as America’s top diplomat have given her iconic status around the world – and deservedly so.
This effort, she knew, requires a willingness to achieve one’s goals in stages, however imperfect.
She made Asians look at America anew.
One challenge is that part of the plot for the US and Clinton is being written by others.
After all that has happened in recent weeks, the definition of “success” must be set low.
Indonesia can be one ally.
Besides her own work, Clinton is likely to also be inundated during this visit with requests concerning President Barack Obama.
NEW YORK – So, why did he do it?
If you are a woman watching, you feel in your gut that these women won't be window dressing.
There is plenty in her experience as First Lady that she has hyped.
A later portion of the war games took place in the Yellow Sea, in international waters very close to China, bluntly demonstrating America’s commitment to freedom of the seas in Asia.
All foreign relations have, it seems, now been made subservient to domestic concerns.
And Chinese intransigence over the South China Sea is a direct result of the economic bonanza it suspects lies on the seabed.
Strident rhetoric and a hegemon’s disdain for the interests of smaller neighbors create only enmity, not harmony.
Historic Election in Egypt?
George Santayana, the Spanish-American poet and philosopher, once warned that "Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it."
In 1879, the longest bridge in the world spanned the River Tay at Dundee, Scotland.
However, the force of the wind was grossly underestimated and worksmanship was inferior.
In 1907, the longest span in the world was being constructed over the St. Lawrence River near Quebec, Canada.
In 1940, the third longest suspension bridge in the world was opened in Washington State.
In 2000, the much-anticipated opening of London's Millennium Bridge over the River Thames was followed only three days later by its closure.
Each used technology that engineers had been confidently employing for bridges, and for which the assumed loads and methods of analysis were well established.
In fact, designing in a climate of success can be dangerous for an engineer.
This was known to Vitruvius, who wrote about Greek and Roman engineering more than 2,000 years ago.
The history of engineering is no mere adjunct to technical know-how.
Building a new bridge following a familiar model can lead to complacency.
The cable-stayed bridge is a form that is currently being pushed to limits and beyond those originally imagined to apply to it.
One draws an analogy with Pearl Harbor, Japan’s attack on the US in 1941.
Sooner or later the Taliban will sweep to power again, at liberty as happened before to throw acid in women’s faces.
Development has been slow.
That is not a prospect that anyone should welcome in South Asia.
BUENOS AIRES: What price justice?
Look at Rwanda.
History’s Ghosts in Iran
In other words: is Iran to be treated as Hitler’s Germany in 1938, Prussia in 1756, or Stalin’s Soviet Union?
But are the two parties ready for it?
The comparison here is to the Cold War period.
Already-large disparities in income and wealth will continue to deepen, amplified by higher inflation and financial repression.
And emerging economies could unleash their consumers, boosting global demand.
They buttressed weakening demand by subsidizing sales, stimulating research into cleaner technologies, and protecting jobs.
This is particularly true of the automobile sector.
You want to donate money to a charity that is working to reduce the toll.
But the information is taken from forms that the charities themselves complete and send to the tax authorities.
Holland After van Gogh
The goal now must be to unite the Dutch people.
Non-committal multiculturalism has long kept the conservatism of Dutch Moroccans and Dutch Turks hidden from the public eye.
It is as simple as that.
Many youngsters now see politics as a kind of computer game.
Context has been lost.
Something similar is happening on the extreme right, with "white power" offering an apparent certainty to youngsters who are adrift.
The real struggle is about ideas.
We do not live together, but in isolation from each other.
This way Islam could really become a source of inspiration for the European community of values.
The Netherlands need not be the focus of international religious conflict.
This process must begin in school.
This is not just a matter for politicians.
No more.
Are famously liberal Hollywood film directors spending too much time going to anti-globalization rallies?
Fine, but what happens to people, like the poor of hurricane-struck New Orleans, who don’t own boats? 
Otherwise, globalization’s storyline may not proceed according to the script.
Holocaust Denial, Nuclear Denial
Holocaust denial is not an argument about the past.
It is an argument about the future.
The point of Holocaust denial is to remove the taboo now associated with the original crime.
Thus, Auschwitz is dismissed as a “detail of history,” in the telling phrase of the French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen.
So, it is time, he wrote Merkel, to “make the shadow of World War II disappear.”
The enduring impact of the Holocaust, explored in hundreds of books and films, was to portray Nazism as the ultimate expression of evil.
It was the furthest extreme of a disaster that incorporated all these other events.
Home Sweet Second Home
They never seemed so much on people’s minds.
America is not alone.
Australians are buying oceanfront properties at the Sunshine Coast and the Whitsundays.
After all, where do we imagine that philosophers and poets and gurus live?
There is reason to worry about this.
Prices could increase much faster at times.
Such higher-density construction must be the best possible outcome, for it will please the most people.
Here are five such truths, or at any rate, five issues for debate:
First, emigration is no fun.
Countries that are magnets for migrants tend to be rich and free.
Canada has become a dream for many, but so are the countries of Europe.
Rich countries need immigrants nowadays in order to fill the jobs that Adair Turner, in his book Just Capital , calls "high-touch" jobs.
This is not the only way forward.
Homeless at Home
This is more than the population of France, the United Kingdom, or Turkey.
In 1998, the UN issued Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, which sets out these legal rights.
We have raised awareness of the plight of the displaced, brought about changes in government policies, and raised billions of dollars to respond to their basic needs.
Nor are rich countries immune.
Homeless in Iraq
The United Nations estimates that, since July, the number has risen by 60,000 every month.
Displaced Iraqis who remain in the country move to areas where their community is strong.
Displaced Shi’a tend to move from the center of the country to the south, Sunnis from the south to the center, and Christians to Nineveh province.
It never fails.
"How can one prevent it in one's children?" Even, occasionally, "Is it contagious?"
These views translate readily into action.
Yet homosexuality remains outside the pale.
The mass media, for instance, pick up on the flamboyant queens and dykes who participate in gay pride parades.
The vast majority of homosexuals, who are indistinguishable from straight men and women, simply don't enter into the picture.
It's OK for a girl to be active and enjoy sports."
Hong Kong Holds its Breath
But that description hardly seems appropriate nowadays.
For this month's election, Hong Kong's 3.2 million registered voters can elect only 30 of the 60 seats.
Only 199,000 voters, some of them representatives from corporations, elect the legislators who fill these seats.
Some of these constituencies have only a few hundred voters and are easily controlled by a small number of vested interests.
So resistance to change is built into the system.
The Civic Exchange-Hong Kong Transition Project's latest survey results, from early August, recorded a sharp upturn in public protests over the past year.
Hong Kong\u0027s Threat to China
Now Taiwan's leaders point to Hong Kong as a failed model of a flawed concept.
On the positive side, the presence of biomarkers will enable drug companies to perform smaller, better-targeted clinical studies in order to demonstrate efficacy.
First, the burden of economic dislocation was borne unequally.
But how does one measure “endeavour” or “notable”?
Hot Rocks
CANBERRA – Ask any power system engineer about renewable energy and you are likely to be told that it doesn’t deliver “base-load” power.
This peaking capacity is built around hydroelectric systems in some countries, but usually it is based on burning fossil fuels such as gas, diesel, or fuel oils.
The answer may be under our feet.
Six thousand kilometers below the surface, the planet’s core is as hot as the surface of the sun.
Yet, even at shallow depths, useful temperatures for power generation are often available.
The shallower the heat resources and the cheaper the capital, the more competitive an HDR project will be.
Deposits of hot dry rocks are common, and large amounts of heat are within reach in many places.
A small power station is operating in Landau, Germany, and others are under construction in France and Australia.
We could, for example, tear down San Francisco’s row houses and replace them with buildings more like those of New York’s Upper West Side.
But we aren’t willing to do that.
The US imports the equivalent of 16% of its GDP.
Pundits who make it into newspaper opinion pages or onto television and radio must have good track records; otherwise, they would have been weeded out.
How can we know?
The evidence falls into two categories.
The result: hedgehogs make more mistakes, but they pile up more hits on Google.
Eclectic foxes are better at curbing their ideological enthusiasms.
Because they avoid over-simplification, foxes make fewer mistakes.
In short, the qualities that make foxes more accurate also make them less popular.
No society has yet created a widely trusted method for keeping score on the punditocracy.
Brexit, Voice, and Loyalty
But it is clear that both voice and loyalty have become a problem for the European Union.
Countries do not like to feel isolated.
Some other attraction may appear.
It wants to remain engaged with the entire world, not just some islands off the European coast.
The outcome resembles a Shakespeare comedy of confused identity.
This claim is not supported by the evidence.
India's Mahatma Ghandi once said that an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth leaves the world blind and toothless.
Of the ten new EU member states, eight have undergone a transformation whose speed and scope has been unprecedented.
In many of the transition countries, inflation was brought down from majestic heights - 251% in Poland in 1989 - and all now have fully convertible currencies.
For example, a new directive requires non-household customers to be able to choose their electricity supplier by July 2004 and their gas supplier by July 2007.
During this period, only 8% of EU students completed part of their studies in another member state.
But, by 2002, only 31 of the FSAP's 42 provisions had been implemented.
But, of the more than 600 CEOs who signed by the deadline, not a single one admitted major error.
Investors also see that the US regulatory system is stronger than the SEC alone.
These states have set a standard for action, and there are 48 more states that could do the same.
So investors know that even if a Federal agency like the SEC overlooks or ignores serious regulatory problems, another regulator might step in.
The implications of pricing oil in any single-currency are more far-reaching than most people think.
As the dollar declines, commodities – including oil – attract investors.
Everyone feels that a seismic shift is under way.
But changing economic balances also lead to changing political balances.
But there was a deep paradox in all of this.
Consider the relationship between science and engineering.
Policy design, political leadership, and human agency come back to life.
There are three ways in which ideas shape interests.
In both cases, the biggest winners were “vested interests” (Korea’s business establishment and the Chinese Communist Party).
There was also mayhem following the Indian Ocean tsunami.
Even for NGOs that stick around, determining their relief efforts’ impact in the middle of a crisis is difficult, if not impossible.
Avoiding Algeria in Egypt
How Europe Can Rescue Europe
That is not what Merkel or the overwhelming majority of Germans stand for.
This agenda would bring immense relief to the financial markets.
The three have to be developed together, step-by-step.
How Free is Speech?
The bishop, then, does not strike one as an attractive man.
Back in Holland, a case is being made against him in an Amsterdam court for “spreading hatred” against Muslims.
The question is, up to what point?
Laws on free speech differ somewhat from country to country.
The problem is where to draw the line.
Legally, this should probably be the point where words are designed to result in violence.
People like Bishop Williamson and Geert Wilders are useful to the extent that they allow us to do just that.
But the heart of the matter is the deterioration of German-American relations.
But wartime victory makes cowards of leaders who backed the wrong side.
At long last, they say, German leaders can use the unrestricted sovereignty Germany acquired with reunification in 1990.
The new facility for which the money is to be earmarked will house 106 prisoners (the precise number is uncertain) who have been neither tried nor charged.
According to the spokesman for the US Southern Command, which oversees Gitmo, the hunger strikers are disillusioned, because they believed Obama’s pledge to close Gitmo.
I recently toured Alcatraz, the former US federal prison in San Francisco Bay.
Solitary confinement in D Block was seen as the harshest punishment, and it was never used for more than 48 hours at a time.
Likewise, in Alcatraz, prisoners had access to a fully stocked library, monthly visits from loved ones, and mail delivery.
They are not even notified of the deaths of parents and children.
The eight hunger strikers are being fed through tubes inserted into their stomachs.
Until then, Americans need to ask themselves what has coarsened in the national conscience between 1963 and today.
How Independent Is The ECB?
With 18 members, the Governing Council is already larger than the governing bodies of the US Federal Reserve Board, the Bank of England, or the Bank of Japan.
How India Survived the Financial Crisis
India relies on external trade for about 20% of its GDP (the figure for China is roughly double).
Among the drivers of growth, domestic capital formation retained much of its momentum from preceding years.
Privatization of India’s bloated public sector (from massive coal and steel enterprises to the loss-making national carrier Air India) has been slow to get off the ground.
The country’s infrastructure remains woeful, as any visitor flying into an Indian airport notices.
India is simultaneously tackling the “hardware” of development (ports, roads, airports) and its “software” (health care, education).
As the 2010 monsoon nourishes India’s plains, that’s an encouraging place to be.
Greece, for example, got into trouble doing precisely this, employing many thousands in the government and overpaying them, even while it ran up public debt to astronomical levels.
In the US, though, there have been strong political forces arrayed against direct redistribution in recent years.
It rarely is.
Is this extraordinary situation stable?
It is the combination of all three of these factors that has created a “perfect storm” for super low interest rates.
Ultra-low interest rates may persist for some time.
It could unwind remarkably quickly.
How Military Should Japan Be?
If a shooting war ever breaks out in Asia, Japan is nowadays prepared to do a lot more than fill the petrol tanks.
Japan's warships can help with sanctions monitoring and minesweeping.
Its ships and aircraft can rescue stranded nationals.
John Maynard Keynes addressed this issue in 1930, in his little essay “Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren.”
Hours of paid work would fall to three a day – a 15-hour week.
Human beings would be more like the “lilies of the field, who toil not, neither do they spin.”
GDP per head in the United Kingdom in the late 1920’s (before the 1929 crash) was roughly £5,200 ($8,700) in today’s value.
In 2007 (i.e., pre-crash), the IMF reported that average GDP per head in the United States stood at $47,000, and at $46,000 in the UK.
In fact they have fallen by only one-third – and have stopped falling since the 1980’s.
The wealthy had a duty to help the poor. Keynes was probably not thinking of the developing world (most of which had hardly started to develop in 1930).
But is greater transparency always good?
Ever since the financial crisis erupted in 2008, there has been a call for “greater transparency” in financial services.
The financial-reform law passed by the United States Congress last month requires improved transparency from banks and other financial-services firms.
A different form of transparency received much more attention last month.
But posting the Afghan war reports was its most controversial move yet.
But even some supporters of open government think Wikileaks goes too far.
But how much openness is too much?
For the religious right and the mullahs, he is an agent of America, the great Satan, and has thus betrayed the cause of Islam.
Many in Musharraf’s own army despise him for the same reason.
In large part, he can thank 9/11.
But the truth is more complex.
How New is Egypt’s “New” Foreign Policy?
These labels are undoubtedly useful to consumers, but it is unlikely that many manufacturers, if given the choice, would have introduced them on their own.
America’s Fiscal Cliff Dwellers
But it should do this fully only once the economy has completely recovered.
We judge leaders not only by the effectiveness of their actions, but also by the meanings that they create and teach. 
To understand power and its contexts in the world today, I have sometimes suggested the metaphor of a three-dimensional chess game.
On the top board of military power among countries, the US is the only superpower.
Nobody is in control. 
That will be the test of his leadership.
The Political Economy of 2013
Close and defining linkages between politics and economics are likely to persist in 2013.
In other countries, the causal direction will run primarily from economics to politics.
That is the good news.
Efforts to relax competition have many faces.
The Fed should know that better than anyone.
The Occupy Wall Street movement began two years ago this month.
That is precisely the point.
The world has changed its supplier of global public goods in the past.
By contrast, there is no country today that is able and willing to step in should the US fail to get its act together.
That happened in a number of countries in the 1970’s and 1980’s.
That is not going to happen in the US.
That is not a risk for the US.
The rate of inflation actually fell in the US during the early 1980’s, when the US last experienced large fiscal deficits.
DHAKA – The global financial crisis of recent years has exposed serious flaws in the world’s financial system.
All profits are plowed back into the company to increase its reach or to improve the product or service that it provides.
It can be recycled without end.
By addressing charitable objectives with social businesses, we can achieve them in a sustainable way.
That would just be putting a Band-Aid on a problem that requires major surgery.
Now is the time to begin creating this world.
Declaring war on terrorism was understandable, perhaps even appropriate, as a figure of speech. The problem is that President Bush meant it literally.
The International Red Cross and others started complaining about abuses as early as December 2002.
The Bush administration knew what it was doing when it declared war on terror and used that pretext for invading Iraq.
By declaring war on terror, Bush united the country behind him.
Might is not necessarily right.
The main threat to America's dominant position comes not from outside, but from within.
A few years ago, when the US Federal Reserve embarked on yet another round of “quantitative easing,” some emerging-market leaders complained loudly.
At first sight, these fears appear to have been well founded.
The cause of this state of affairs, in one word, is austerity.
And any global recovery promises to be unbalanced – that is, if it materializes at all.
How the French Plunder Africa
This arrangement's negative effects extend, moreover, to the entire African continent.
For the citizens of Francophone Africa, this will certainly have tragic consequences.
A Time for Action in the Middle East
We think of it as a normal political party.
The Muslim Brotherhood is not such a party.
Becoming a member is a seven-year process of induction and indoctrination.
Assad would remain in power in the richest part of the country, with bitter sectarian fury reigning in the country’s eastern hinterland.
But others are taking sides.
In this struggle, we should not be neutral.
And the forces that made intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq so difficult are of course the very forces at the heart of the storm today.
They have to be defeated.
How to Avoid a Double-Dip Global Recession
In fact, policymakers are damned if they do and damned if they don’t.
When markets panic, as they did in 1929 and again in 2008, supporting the financial system is essential.
The alternative would be a 1930’s-style depression.
Japan recapitalized its banks in 1998, but did not wipe out equity holders.
How could things have been managed differently?
But it is not enough to have many small banks.
Let me first set the scene by making three observations on where we are today.
Let me now turn to policy.
I have little doubt that learning by doing will eventually lead to coherent programs.
But time has been lost.&nbsp;
How to End the Greek Tragedy
European leaders seem to be moving in this direction.
But, if the past 18 months are any guide, they soon will be.
Bolivia.
Nonsense.
The new minister went around the country, looked at every single form to be filled out in the various interfaces with the government.
- Trickle-down economics almost never works.
National Governments, Global Citizens
But the gap is smaller for young people, the better educated, and the professional classes.
How to Help Burma
But the “glass ceiling” is only a small part of the issue.
The potential gains from a larger female workforce are striking.
In the United Arab Emirates, GDP would expand by 12%, in Japan by 9%, and in the United States by 5%.
Take my word for it.
MELBOURNE – Did you make any New Year’s resolutions?
In his recently released book 59 Seconds, Wiseman sets out the things that you can do to make success more likely:
·         Break your resolution into a series of small steps;
·         Give yourself a small reward each time you achieve one of the steps towards your goal;
·         Keep track of your progress towards your goal, for example by keeping a journal or putting a chart on the fridge door.
Individually, each of these factors seems trivial.
How to Make EU Integration Popular
This approach has been successfully implemented in Australia, New Zealand, and Switzerland; Germany and Great Britain are following suit.
New Model Europe
The second issue is the need to take further steps toward closer integration within the eurozone.
Lending rates are still too high for small and medium-size enterprises and too dependent on where in the EU a company is located.
So we must make the single market more open, internally and externally.
For many people, EU decision-making is opaque, inefficient, and removed from democratic control.
The choice is clear, and it will have to be made sooner rather than later.
How to Make Trade Easier
But moving in this direction, even if imperfectly, would mean real progress.
More monetary and credit easing is also required for the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, and the Swiss National Bank.
The Egypt-Israel Peace Test
Eurozone banks became among the world’s most over-leveraged – and the worst-affected by the crash of 2008.
And it would interfere much less with national sovereignty than would the subordination of fiscal policies to an EU or eurozone-wide authority.
While the principle is clear, the details will require a lot of work.
Which supranational agency will be in charge of issuing eurobonds?
What rules will it follow in authorizing issuance?
The board would constitute the fiscal counterpart of the European Central Bank; it would also be the European counterpart of the International Monetary Fund.
The debate will therefore revolve around voting rights.
Which system should prevail?
This is the most difficult of the three problem areas, and I do not claim to have a ready solution.
How to Save the Euro
Among Swedish industrial workers, the figure is 75% in favor.
Sweden accumulated a current-account surplus of 53% of GDP, in contrast to America’s 48%-of-GDP deficit.
Official policy aims to reduce the cost of globalization for individuals, but never for companies.
Could the Scandinavian model work for others?
They require deep, fundamental changes.
All politics is local, and there is no local constituency for the global economy, so what triumphs often erodes global imbalances further.
Perhaps non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like Oxfam or Mothers against Land Mines suggest a way.
The ability of grassroots movements to influence policy is set to increase.
But there is an organization that could do the job: the IMF.
Instead, they will have a political mandate to attend meaningfully to the welfare of the global economy.
But their formulation is inconsistent.
And why these particular goals?
Today, 1.6 billion people do not have electricity; when the sun sets, their lives are literally beset by darkness.
Yet its impact on global temperature in a hundred years will be immeasurable.
How to Undermine an Alliance
In August 2009, Japan’s people voted for “change.”
It makes no sense to have that base located in the middle of a densely populated town, making it one of the most visible and tempting targets in the world.
Last year, President Obama’s chief of staff Rahm Emanuel remarked that a good crisis should never be wasted.
Responses to a crisis fall into two categories.
Rescuing automobile producers looks good to their employees and suppliers.
Such rescues, in short, appear to help big companies with bad managers.
But, in the real world, not everyone is underneath the helicopter when it makes the drop.
For example, long before the financial collapse, experimental economists joined psychologists in attempting to measure varying propensities to greediness.
How United Is \
Indeed, since the US intervention in Iraq, many West Europeans see the EU's new members from Europe's East as something of a bloc.
In reality, big differences exist among the new EU members.
Still others - for example, Slovenia - stood on the side of "old Europe."
Historical traditions also play a role.
Although all new member states claim to be "western," some are more Western than others.
Moreover, communism in those states was different than that practiced in the three Baltic countries, which were part of the Soviet Union.
The Visegrad initiative worked to some extent, though it was temporarily paralyzed by the disintegration of Czechoslovakia just over a decade ago.
It is also time to start thinking about a new way of organizing Central Europe.
Such a regional group would be bound together by a long common history and compatible interests.
How Will Tomorrow’s Scientists Learn?
It will be facilitated through Web-based social software, through wikis, blogs, and similar developments as much as through new, “open source” business models.
How Women Go Bankrupt
But just 65% of women with college degrees are now working.
But the evidence suggests otherwise.
But Senators Elizabeth Warren and John McCain, a powerful duo, have returned to the fight.
Only the retail subsidiaries would be permitted to rely on the central bank for lender-of-last-resort support.
But EU institutions have not been entirely inactive.
The French plan looks more like a Gallic version of the Volcker rule than Vickers “à la française.”
That is why China fascinates American investors, among others, and why US customers buy Chinese products.
China and the US both have much to gain by thwarting Taiwan’s move toward independence.
I was in Venezuela on September 11, 2001, to attend a conference on the “Third Way.”
Chávez himself, dressed in fatigues, briefly graced the meeting with his presence, receiving a heavy volume of Marxist texts from an elderly professor.
As a result, no one worked hard.
They see him as a damaging buffoon, rather than as a dangerous revolutionary.”
He survived it, and went on to win a second, a third, and then a fourth term.
In early 2013, the government was forced to announce a 32% devaluation, and stopped issuing government debt in dollars.
Chávez’s petro-diplomacy sometimes took bizarre forms, like providing cheap bus travel for Londoners to please London’s left-wing mayor, Ken Livingstone.
He is sure to enter the pantheon of Latin American heroes.
And what about the Third Way?
Human Change We Can Believe In
For example, if larger individuals produce more children than smaller ones, the number of larger individuals would grow, thereby increasing the average size of individuals in the population.
According to Jokela, selection pressure favors people of both sexes who are extroverted, open to experience, and less anxious.
Recently developed statistical tools have finally made this possible.
MADISON –Humans are undeniably complex, and proud of it.
This analysis leads us to examine proteins – our cellular building blocks and the executors of biologicalfunctions – across vastly different species.
Proteins with common ancestry belonging to different species, termed “orthologs,” offer solid ground for comparison.
Proteins that retain the same function across very different species – generally the case with orthologs – are expected to keep the same fold.
But the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein chains in these orthologs can vary significantly.
Better still, in what sense are we more complex?
In these structures, something subtler than overall topology changes across orthologs.
Thus, humans (or mammals) have significantly smaller (ten or more orders of magnitude) populations than bacteria.
A protein that is richer in dehydrons than its ortholog is more vulnerable to becoming disrupted by surrounding water.
Thus, protein-protein interactions, a hallmark of complexity, are actually promoted by randomdrift, the evolutionary force behind the protein degradation process.
Let’s hope we pass the test.
People who came down with it were ejected from their communities.
Even members of the medical profession have been known to discriminate against patients with leprosy.
They state that no one should be discriminated against on the grounds of having or having had leprosy.
But the UN resolution is, unfortunately, not a binding document.
It is very important, therefore, that this resolution is not simply filed away and forgotten.
Do both march in tandem around the globe?
War criminals are put on trial in The Hague.
Women's rights are on the social and political agenda in the Middle East.
The paradox is clear.
But the evisceration of US labor law also reflects the extraordinary power of America's culture of rights.
As we mark this anniversary, the question is how to protect the inherent dignity and equal rights of all people.
This is reason for hope. 
We have global goals and shared destinies that connect us.
Making matters worse, Israeli politicians remain committed to further enlargement of Israel’s West Bank settlements.
But it begs the question of why there has not been a more concerted and concentrated focus on transforming the situation in Gaza and Palestine.
One key element in building up a structure for reconciliation must be economic growth.
Scientific research – and biomedical research in particular – largely resembles a race.
Human geneticists, like big-game hunters, specialize in finding disease genes – the “prize.”
Many other countries are undertaking similar programs.
Both stories are flawed.
US consumers buy imports rather than American-made goods because imports are cheaper.
Consequently, wages are market sustainable.
In short, the draft constitution is an attempt to square a circle.
Hunting the Higgs
But the models worked only if the particles inside of atoms had no mass.
Some physicists invented a clever workaround.
They suggested that a type of particle exists that had never been detected; it was eventually named in honor of the British physicist Peter Higgs.
Now, following research conducted at CERN, the sprawling particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, the hunt may soon be over.
But suppose that everything around us – every single particle in the universe – is immersed in a huge, unseen vat of Higgs particles.
Whenever most kinds of particles move from point A to point B, they continually bump into Higgs particles, slowing their motion.
Higgs particles might have played an even more substantial role at earlier moments in cosmic history.
According to the Standard Model, Higgs particles scatter off each other, so they, too, should have mass.
The second difficulty concerns statistics.
The rules of quantum theory, on which the Standard Model is built, are at root probabilistic.
But the link certainly is plausible.
That is how good science works.
Hypocrisy and War
MELBOURNE – All the world hates a hypocrite.
But their practical utility, combined with long philosophical pedigree, justifies much greater visibility.
Hypocrisy on the High Seas?
Thirty years ago, Australian vessels, with the government’s blessing, killed sperm whales off the West Australian coast.
But there is no essential human need that requires us to kill whales.
Thus, whaling is unethical.
Frost agreed.
It is, for example, one of the first precepts of one of Japan’s major ethical traditions, Buddhism.
The Australian government strongly opposes whaling, yet it permits the killing of millions of kangaroos each year – a slaughter that involves a great deal of animal suffering.
I Want My Al Jazeera
The station’s US push could hardly be more necessary – to Americans.
Egypt has 30 newspapers and more than 200 television channels.
I met Mohyeldin before a recent public appearance in Manhattan.
Ideas over Interests
It’s the same globally.
Policymakers, like all of us, are slaves to fashion.
It was economists and their ideas that made it respectable for policymakers and regulators to believe that what is good for Wall Street is good for Main Street.
Likewise, the standard economic analysis of racial discrimination is that whites do not want to associate with non-whites, and so demand a premium to buy from or work with non-whites.
People take such codes seriously.
But we can explain it if we ask how people think about themselves – that is, if we examine changes in gender norms.
This example is just the tip of the iceberg.
If Fish Could Scream
PRINCETON – When I was a child, my father used to take me for walks, often along a river or by the sea.
Not for fish.
A typical salmon farm churns through 3-4 kilograms of wild fish for every kilogram of salmon that it produces.
Let’s assume that all this fishing is sustainable, though of course it is not.
But the nervous systems of fish are sufficiently similar to those of birds and mammals to suggest that they do.
When fish experience something that would cause other animals physical pain, they behave in ways suggestive of pain, and the change in behavior may last several hours.
(It is a myth that fish have short memories.)
Her recent book Do Fish Feel Pain? shows that fish are not only capable of feeling pain, but also are a lot smarter than most people believe.
Is it because they are cold-blooded and covered in scales?
We are ignorant masses awash in information.
Ignoring Serbia
And, in Serbia’s case, this question remains open regarding Kosovo and – in a more concealed way – Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
How low will the dollar go?
Central bankers try to soothe and reassure, but they are not very convincing.
I disagree.
Of course, it was subject to ups and downs, but it was not subject to financial crises of the type that we see regularly today.
Images of Scarcity
The conventional “fundamental” explanation for that cycle relates it to political events.
The 1973-1974 oil crisis is said to have been due to the cutoff of oil following the Arab-Israeli Yom Kippur War.
The rate of increase in the world’s population rose from 1.8% in 1951 to 2.1% in 1971.
But those were just dry statistics.
The first photograph of the earth from space came as part of the Apollo project in November 1967.
One of the Apollo astronauts, James B. Irwin, who landed on the moon in 1971, said of his view of the earth, “It was so far away…a little ball in the blackness of space.
The Club of Rome’s monumental book The Limits to Growth came out in 1972, with a picture of the earth on its cover.
Despite scientific critics of the Club of Rome’s methods, the public was ready to believe the dire forecast.
Try searching YouTube, for example, on Greenland ice.
The ability to communicate via e-mail to everyone in the world creates a sense of the world’s smallness relative to the abundance of people in it.
We have seen photographs of hurricane and typhoon activity due to global warming, affecting people in Louisiana or Myanmar.
The North Pole turned into a lake for the first time in 2000.
We practically can’t buy caviar from the Caspian Sea any more.
Imagining Recession
Today, the real price of oil is nearly twice as high as it was at the peak of that crisis, but we have seen nothing like the images from 1973-5.
But images of the 1987 crash, driven by computers in tall modern steel-and-glass office buildings, do seem to be on people’s minds today.
No previous anniversary of the 1987 crash showed any such drop.
I have recently been struck by an analogy from German history: the disaster of German leadership during World War I, epitomized by Kaiser Wilhelm II.
Wilhelm assumed the throne in 1888 at age 29, his liberal father having reigned for 88 days before succumbing to throat cancer.
Within two years, Wilhelm II dismissed Bismarck.
Wilhelm II became the leader of a country on the cusp of European mastery.
He gave astounding orders to soldiers departing to suppress the Boxer Rebellion in China: they should awaken fear as had the Huns of yore.
Some of this had to do with his ambivalent anglophobia and his distrust of his mother, Queen Victoria’s daughter.
But Wilhelm did not in fact rule, as Germany’s conduct during WWI made clear.
Once war started, Wilhelm became Supreme War Lord, and his chief function would have been to adjudicate among rival elements within his government.
Moreover, military and civilian leaders were divided among themselves.
From then on, the Kaiser’s mental state became a dominant issue in the war’s conduct.
The fate of his country (and of Europe) depended on how Wilhelm decided.
Meanwhile, the Kaiser was systematically shielded from the truth and became estranged from reality.
But the Allies wouldn’t negotiate with the Kaiser.
War-weary Germans began to demand the Kaiser’s abdication.
Of course, America is not Imperial Germany.
It wasn’t just that distance lends a certain enchantment to any view.
Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History and the Last Man testified to this sense of triumph and historical duty.
But that is the weakest line of attack.
Ferguson, too, can make a sound argument for such a proposition.
For the moment, most of us have lost the historical plot.
Europe’s Plan A
Germany blames France, and vice versa.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
In the American case, the principles of federal finance were not worked out until the Civil War, and the Federal Reserve System was established even later, coming only in 1913.
In 1973, at the end of the Yom Kippur War, Israel was poised to encircle the entire Egyptian Third Army in Sinai.
Soviet intervention became a real threat.
Health Care’s New Frontier
Xinjiang covers nearly 650,000 square miles (1.7 million square kilometers), but it is home to only 21 million people, many of whom are members of nomadic tribes.
Free medicines are only part of the solution.
Without these components, the model collapses.
They need to work together to achieve the best possible outcome.
Surgery, although not always curative, is the mainstay of treatment because most tumors left in place will spread.
Systemic treatment given after surgery is called “adjuvant therapy”.
Interaction with these receptors can kill cancer cells.
That reflected the substantial progress Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti’s government had already made.
Reflecting these reforms, the International Monetary Fund recently projected that Italy will have a cyclically adjusted budget surplus of nearly 1% of GDP in 2013.
Despite cuts in government spending and increases in taxes, the IMF still projects the cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit to exceed 3.2% of GDP in 2013 and 2.3% of GDP in 2015.
The key to solving Spain’s fiscal problem lies in the semi-autonomous regions that generate spending and shift the financing burden to Madrid.
How do you feel about publishing now?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So you wait to publish.
Your book becomes bigger.&#160; Impossibly big.
It is a good thing you do not have to work for a living.
This appears to satisfy everyone, but it puts you in panic mode. 
In Defense of International Justice
An Argentine naval officer who had resettled in Mexico under an assumed name was wanted by Spain on charges of genocide, torture, and terrorism.
The officer, Ricardo Miguel Cavallo, was implicated in abuses committed in 1977 and 1978 at the notorious Naval Mechanics School in Buenos Aires.
In Defense of Polish Plumbers
Supporters of Europe’s social model claim that what distinguishes it is the importance placed on “social cohesion.”
In fact, some transfers flow the other way.
Workers’ incomes in Britain and Ireland have not fallen measurably, despite both countries’ openness to immigration from the enlarged EU.
It will remain so.
I have mixed feelings about these penalties.
In Defense of Swiss Banking
Tax fraud is a criminal offense in Switzerland.
But I have not quite finished with the OECD.
The OECD is a multinational grouping of 30 countries established nearly a half-century ago, with Switzerland a member.
Of the world’s tax evaders, 99.99% do not have a bank account in Switzerland, but Switzerland is an easy target.
That, after all, is the point of Europe’s straightjacket of austerity, which hampers its growth prospects, and thus makes little sense in economic terms.
Northern Europe must hold up its side of the bargain.
That cannot be allowed to happen again.
For example, asset management, distribution, underwriting and securitization, and proprietary trading would be separated in various ways.
Yet such values shape other professions.
It is limited by professional values that are inculcated throughout doctors’ training, and which are bolstered by a quiet form of peer review.
But this was – or was supposed to be – transient.
Second, democratic politics balances the market.
But, over the past generation, confidence in the “Kuznets curve” has faded.
On the private supply side, higher returns have not called forth more investment in people.
Consider Martin Wolf, a columnist at The Financial Times .
But Wolf’s solution is not enough, for the problem is not confined to high finance.
That demand must be abandoned.
In Praise of Parasites
Recently it was pronounced extinct - the first documented extinction of a primate since the 1700s.
Often the first host is prey for the second, and so the parasites helps the predators catch their prey.
Many of the most effective drugs, for example, were originally discovered in plants or animals. 
Parasites are masters of biotechnology.
Biotech researchers are so impressed by the hookworm that they've synthesized the molecule and are testing it as a blood-thinning medicine that can be used during surgery. 
That horror is what makes parasites such a great device for science fiction movies such as Alien. 
Our host is the biosphere, which we exploit and consume for our own advantage, and to our host's detriment. 
If we are in fact parasites, we are not very good ones.
Parasites make very careful use of their hosts, because killing them off too quickly will leave them without a home.
We should learn from the masters.
Until 1910, British legislators were unpaid.
Most offenses were trivial, and only a few were illegal.
The older language of trust has been replaced by a new language of “accountability” and “transparency.”
Today, the systems by which most services are provided have become almost completely opaque to their users.
Complexity, by leading to moral ambiguities, forces relationships onto a contractual footing.
Parliamentarians are by no means the only, or chief, victims of the cold blast of public mistrust.
We have a choice.
Unity is supposed to be a foundation of prosperity.
All of this recalls some powerful arguments that were made in the nineteenth century about national integration and unification.
Italians shared the same belief after the disillusion of 1848.
The great Florentine liberal statesman, Bettino Ricasoli, concluded that Tuscany was simply financially unviable on its own.
A reduction in borrowing costs constituted a powerful motive in the 1990’s for southern European governments to join the monetary union.
But marriage can be a fraught institution (as Strauss-Kahn may know better than most).
In the D-Mark’s Shadow
More ominously, it looked for a while like the Norwegian Nobel committee itself might bow to Beijing, too.
Over the next two decades, he was imprisoned several times, and held under house arrest when not in prison.
The Communist Party of China used to rule a destitute power.
This model, which some have dubbed “The Beijing Consensus” is explicit: there are no moral standards, only material ones.
But even here there is a paradox for the regime.
Awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize lifts the hopes of all of us who dream of a truly free and civilized China.
Look beyond the insults and you see that Koštunica and Labus have similar moderate programs.
He also instigated many violent incidents in Serbian internal politics.
But Parliament is the seat of real political power here.
But, while the film is full of emotion and provocative images, it is short on rational arguments.
A billion don’t have clean drinking water.
Gore shows that glaciers have receded for 50 years.
Were realistic levels not dramatic enough?
The United Nations panel on climate change suggests a rise of only 1-2 feet during this century, compared to almost one foot in the last century.
At the climax of his movie, Gore argues that future generations will chastise us for not having committed ourselves to the Kyoto Protocol.
Sometime this year, the United States Congress is likely to vote on the “US-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Initiative,” signed when President Bush visited New Delhi in March.
But there is nothing new about that.
Not all countries are equal.
Transparency and the rule of law are the norm, and its government does all it can to fight terrorism.
The message seems to have gotten through to North Korea; we have seen no nuclear weapons test, despite its probable ability to so.
Unfortunately, there is no country in a position to influence Iran to the extent that China can influence North Korea.
This said, a US preventive strike at Iran’s nuclear-related installations is not in the interest of either country.
The stakes could hardly be greater.
India at Play
Football?
Basketball?
Cricketers occupy a place in India’s pantheon rivaled only by gods and Bollywood stars.
In no other country does a sport so often command the front pages of leading newspapers.
Cricket first came to India with decorous English gentlemen.
In April and May, the new Indian Premier League revolutionized the sport.
In the old days, cricket was reproached as a sport played by Anglicized elites in the big cities.
But now cricket is followed by the masses all over the country.
Cricket, once the sport of the British upper classes, is in India a great leveler.
India at the UN High Table
This is an unusual year at the UN high table.
Several powerful states, whose growing global role has made them aspirants to permanent seats on a reformed Security Council, will serve alongside India.
India is the only country that belongs to all four.
What explains this seeming contradiction?
He is exhorted in the media and among the intellectual classes.
India in Africa
Instead, it needs to invest in the region’s human capital and share Indian know-how.
Many Indian goods have much greater suitability for African than Western markets.
India’s democracy in a post-colonial setting has relevant lessons for Africa.
India or China?
The race was finally on.
As one wit has observed, the PC (personal computer) and the CP (Communist Party) do not go together.
Clicks over Bricks in India
Quite clearly, the established framework of retailing is being fundamentally overhauled.
For small shopkeepers, this poses both a challenge and an opportunity.
As rising affluence and falling technology prices make online shopping accessible to a growing pool of customers, more products will follow.
In other words, small shops may be more than capable of holding their own against big retailers if they adapt to the new environment.
No other country has created a logistical network directly for online retailing.
A plan of attack that involved hundreds of people was put in motion, and yet the massive infrastructure of India’s government discovered nothing.
India is a tough nation.
It has fought off Muslim terrorists in Kashmir, Sikh terrorists in Punjab, Christian terrorists in Nagaland, and Hindu terrorists in Assam and across the country.
It understands that you cannot blame the whole community for the sins of a few.
I am an Indian and a Muslim and proud to be both.
India\u0027s Bollywood Power
Take Afghanistan, for instance – a major security concern for India, as it is for the world. But India’s greatest asset there doesn’t come out of a military mission: it doesn't have one.
Indian art, classical music and dance have the same effect.
Indian cuisine, spreading around the world, raises Indian culture higher in people's reckoning; the way to foreigners’ hearts is through their palates.
India is already the “land of the better story.”
There’s still much for India to do to ensure that its people are healthy, well fed, and secure.
Progress is being made: the battle against poverty is slowly (too slowly) being won.
When the sun sets in Myanmar, fear rises.
People were being denounced left and right.
India\u0027s China Syndrome
Another goal should be to increase the government's spending on research and development, especially in areas of health, agriculture, environment and information technology.
Favorable demographic realities are in the mind of policy makers.
India, the land of asylum for the Dalai Lama and the angry young hotheads of the Tibetan Youth Congress, finds itself on the horns of a dilemma.
On the other hand, India has been cultivating better relations with China, which humiliated India in a brief border war in 1962.
Indian information technology firms have opened offices in Shanghai, and Infosys’s headquarters in Bangalore recruited nine Chinese this year.
India has no desire to jeopardize any of this.
The Dalai Lama’s curious position has complicated India’s diplomatic dance with China.
He is the most recognized worldwide symbol of a country that he has not seen for nearly five decades.
That position is not without detractors.
India will continue to balance delicately on its Tibetan tightrope.
India’s Democracy at 60
No one speaks seriously any more of the danger of disintegration.
But at best I have mixed emotions.
In addition, 76.2% of schools do not have clean drinking water, while 14.6% lack electricity.
Of the remaining 120 million, only 20 million are expected to reach the tenth year of school, with the rest dropping out along the way.
Indeed, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recently expressed dismay over the fact that “only 47 out of 100 children enrolled in class I reach class VIII.”
However, recent years have witnessed a steady decline in educational spending, from 4% of GDP in 2001-02 to 3.8% in 2002-04 and 3.5% in 2004-05.
Yet there the parallels end.
And that makes all the difference.
Access to literacy and to jobs in the government sector and modern professions was limited to a small section of the population usually belonging to the high castes.
The size of holdings was similar for most upper castes and some lower castes.
In any case, the majority of peasants belonging to any caste, upper or lower, were poor.
In some regions, e.g., Mysore (Karnataka), Madras (Tamil Nadu) and Uttar Pradesh, some lower castes occupy higher economic positions than high castes.
Sometimes, well-off sections of low castes broke away to form new castes and managed to achieve higher ritual status.
India’s New Ruling Caste
Obviously, India is not a failed state.
The way India’s political system evolved has made politics the surest path to wealth.
Most of these parties are led by political dynasties that prize loyalty over merit.
We are seeing the formation of a new Indian caste – a caste of rulers different from India’s traditional Kshatriya caste – before our very eyes.
And, as with the older castes, there is no need for any qualification for the vocation; birth alone is sufficient.
India’s Olympic Also-Rans
International sport is, of course, an exercise in national chauvinism by other means.
In sport, however, it is a different story.
Our cricketers have come close to being considered the best in the world, but cricket is not an Olympic sport.
In fact, in the Olympics, India’s record has declined over time.
In everything where simple human prowess is at stake – running, jumping, swimming, lifting, throwing - Indians simply don’t have what it takes.
Why do Indian athletes perform so badly?
But even that is a larger population base than a hundred countries that do better than India at the Olympics.
With all these factors, failure in the Olympics, it is suggested, is encoded in our national DNA.
Indian genes in a developing country did not prevent Vijay Singh emerging from Fiji to rival Tiger Woods as the best golfer in the world.
India\u0027s Pseudo-Democracy
According to Vajpayee, "The outer shell of democracy is, no doubt, intact, but appears to be moth-eaten from inside."
But with the assassinations of Indira Gandhi and her son, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Congress disintegrated and has not recovered.
Of course, no magic bullet will do away with the forces that divide India.
India\u0027s Second Great Mutiny?
For all its long history, India is a young country, with perhaps 70% of its population under 30 years of age.
The BJP has always evoked instinctive fear among Muslims.
The current Deputy Prime Minister, Lal Kishan Advani, was present when the structure was brought down.
As the only state in India with a Muslim majority, Jammu and Kashmir has a special status under India's Constitution.
India\u0027s Untouchable Apartheid
When it comes to Pakistan, too, India seems to lack confidence.
But India does not seem to know how to deal with its northwestern neighbor, and even less whom to deal with in its government.
India’s exchanges with Russia are only one-fifth of what they are with China.
What prevails nowadays in New Delhi and Moscow is simple pragmatism.
But they did so unevenly.
But the majority of children in Kerala and Tamil Nadu are already in school, while in Bihar they are not.
These five poor states contain 45% of India's population, and 56% of its poor.
The environmental impact of 1.5 billion inhabitants forms the other major challenge.
Air, soil, and water pollution has been growing, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths every year.
If the population grows by 50%, the country will need to grow 50% more food, if it is to continue to feed itself.
But there won't be any more water.
But there is also far too much populist politicking, with promises of free water for farmers.
What of the euro?
India is simply rising again to reassert its traditional global position.
Can India achieve this?
But this advantage is limited in duration, lasting two or perhaps three decades.
Indonesia’s Democratic Islam
Of the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, only Indonesia has a “free” rating from Freedom House.
But what lessons are to be learned from Indonesian democracy?
Ironically, the US has done as much to block the efforts of Indonesia’s women’s-rights activists as it has to support them.
Religion permeates almost every aspect of life in Indonesia, including politics.
But political parties advocating for implementation of Sharia have lost ground in successive elections from 1955 to 2009.
The parties that still support Sharia have largely disappeared or changed their platform.
Rather than taking over the state, Islamist parties have been forced by the electorate to alter their policies to account for Indonesian pluralism.
Indonesia\u0027s Democratic Miracle
Instead, Indonesia, the world’s most populous Islamic country, has emerged as a beacon of freedom and democracy for the Muslim world.
The story is as complex as Indonesia itself.
Today, however, many of those Chinese have returned. In a remarkable development, Chinese language and culture, which had been suppressed for decades, is allowed free expression.
Indeed, in 2005 Freedom House declared that Indonesia had moved from “partly free” to “free.”
Today, the biggest threat to Indonesia’s democracy comes from America, even though most Americans want Indonesia’s democracy to succeed.
Indonesia’s Moderate Muslims
In Egypt, Abduh’s progressive ideas gained support from only a tiny group of reformers.
The traditonalist organization Nahdlatul Ulama
The state established a wide network of educational institutions that support this moderate tendency.
Industrial Policy Comes Out of the Cold
Industrial Policy Returns from the Grave
PALO ALTO – One of the worst responses by officials to the financial crisis and deep recession has been to revive “industrial policy.”
That is why economists of all political persuasions agree that governments should fund basic science and technology.
For example, the computer-linking technology that created the Internet was funded by an agency of the US Defense Department.
But even in the US, industrial policy is making a comeback.
It should fund basic scientific and technological research applicable to these issues.
But no policy makes sense if it cannot be sustained without long-term government support.
The pattern of flying geese is a useful metaphor to explain this idea.
Then, we may see a golden age for all.
In fact, entire countries have a built-in egalitarian streak.
Things are not quite so simple.
In most countries, it should probably be higher than it is now.
When wealth turns into unchecked power, something must be done to restrict it.
Florida is a much more materially unequal society than Cuba.
But alternatives that would have made the South richer at the price of reducing the wealth of the North would require a wholesale revolution in human psychology.
Some people work harder, apply their intelligence more skillfully, or simply have been lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.
Similar patterns are found elsewhere.
Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Steve Ballmer, and the other millionaires and billionaires of Microsoft are brilliant, hardworking, entrepreneurial, and justly wealthy.
An unequal society cannot help but be an unjust society.
Inflation Comes to China
SHANGHAI – Macroeconomic conditions in any country are like running water.
How large and fast is the flow?
Where does it originate and where does it go?
Not surprisingly, the economy began to overheat.
No one wants to relive the anti-inflation fights of the 1980’s and 1990’s.
Fiscal policy should ideally focus on tax cuts and infrastructure spending.
Many banks have already acknowledged their open-ended losses in residential mortgages.
Those who worry about deflation note that the US consumer price index has not increased at all in the past three months.
There was always a problem in this approach, namely that the general price level is an abstraction.
At these moments, it is easiest to accommodate the movements by letting all prices rise, but to differing extents.
But the oil-price shocks that came after 1973 were in part also a response to the major industrial countries’ monetary policy in the later 1960’s and early 1970’s.
Another way to approach it is to attempt to grasp changing consumer behavior analytically.
As a result, inflation is continually being redefined.
A better approach is to think of the longer-term story as being one of changes in relative prices, which are not well handled by a consumer price index.
That issue is especially acute in the wake of a generalized real-estate crisis.
Consumer goods therefore seemed to be getting cheaper.
Consider the French Revolution, which began in 1789.
If the price of automobiles had fallen as quickly as the price of semiconductors, a car today would cost $5.
Size still matters.
How will the ensuing drama unfold?
Who will win, and who will lose?
Inherited Malignancy
HANNOVER , GERMANY – Breast cancer is among the most life-threatening of malignancies, affecting about one in ten women in the Western world.
One class contains mutations in genes involved in DNA repair.
Considering frequency and risk, this class of breast cancer susceptibility factors can be called “rare, intermediate-penetrance mutations”.
The other class involves what are known as “common, low-penetrance variants.”
Last, but not least, criteria have to be established to define when and to whom genetic testing should be offered.
Thus, “to test or not to test” is not the first question that needs to be answered.
Innocent Bystanders
SANTIAGO – Take a taxi in São Paulo nowadays and you will experience the maddening traffic and untidy streets of an emerging-country metropolis.
So, what is going on?
But, starting in 2010, the imbalances returned, and, according to the International Monetary Fund’s recently released World Economic Outlook, they will not shrink between now and 2016.
Before the crisis, a substantial amount of that money was invested in US, Spanish, or Irish real estate.
Innovation and Philosophy
MIAMI – Is it possible to learn to innovate?
Is innovation something that can be taught at school?
Indeed, innovation is simply a subset of scientific knowledge.
Or, as Karl Popper put it, truth is never definitive and error is always probable.
For years, the US had a so-called “return privilege.”
One hypothesis is that this reflected better choices by US investment bankers.
Since their creation in Prussia in 1769 under Frederick the Great, not a single Pfandbrief has defaulted.
Incentive structures have been overwhelmingly aligned to short-term performance.
Financial institutions – and their trade bodies – are doing themselves no favors by vigorously opposing meaningful reform.
But quality and brand must be delivered at the right price.
Demand for consumer products typically follows an S-curve.
At higher levels of income, markets become saturated and growth slows.
Identifying growth hot spots is only the start.
MELBOURNE – Is Iran really hell-bent on becoming a nuclear-armed state?
Does the difference matter?
But there is also a clear view that Arab-Persian, Sunni-Shia, or more straightforward regional power anxieties would make a nuclear-arms race inevitable.
And it is not without plausibility: Iran did not, after all, respond in kind when it was bombarded with chemical weapons by Iraq.
Iran is an extraordinarily complex country.
As Arisotle put it, “politics is the master science in the realm of action.”
Thai political expert Chaiwat Satha-Anand has called the movement a “network without a core.”
Some victims have been killed extra-judicially.
The one group not targeted by anyone has been Westerners.
Malay Muslims in Thailand’s southern provinces are demanding their own political space.
Why Turkey is Thriving
To the southeast is war-torn Syria, which has already disgorged almost 400,000 refugees into Turkey.
And to the northeast lie Armenia and Georgia.
And the government has won three consecutive general elections, each time with a greater share of the popular vote.
Even a short stay in Ankara allows one to see these underlying strengths.
Much of the advanced engineering is homegrown.
Turkey’s universities are rising as well.
Many top programs are in English, ensuring that Turkey will attract an increasing number of international students.
Until a few years ago, the waste was dumped into a fetid, stinking, noxious landfill.
The electricity is returned to the city’s power grid, while the heat exhaust is piped to the facility’s greenhouses, which produce tomatoes, strawberries, and orchids.
Any combination of crises – the eurozone, Syria, Iraq, Iran, or world oil prices – could create instability.
How else could Iraq have managed to put its power stations back in production after the Gulf War?
He wound up at the American Air Force base in Incirlik in southern Turkey.
Hans Blix, the director of the new inspections effort, has been fooled twice before by the Iraqis.
All the research and production facilities are under Iraqi, not UN, control.
The real test will be for the Americans.
Something similar could be created for the European Parliament, and so on.
Almost universally in the world today, homeowners’ insurance is short term.
Moreover, global warming appears to be increasing the intensity of storms.
To see why, consider health or life insurance.
Indeed, a large share of New Orleans homeowners – 60% in Orleans Parish – were completely uninsured against floods.
Cat bonds have been growing in importance in recent years.
According to estimates by Lane Financial, there were $1.8 billion worth of cat bonds issued in the year April 2004-March 2005.
Since Katrina, issuance has accelerated.
The total value of outstanding cat bonds is small by Katrina standards.
Integrating Russia’s Post-Imperium
Putin plans to stay in the Kremlin for two more presidential terms, another 12 years, as he is enabled to do by the recently-amended constitution.
One issue, however, has now shot to the top of Russia’s political agenda: Eurasian integration.
In early October, Putin wrote a newspaper article that proclaimed what appears to be his reigning foreign-policy goal: a Eurasian Union of former Soviet states.
Eurasian economic integration, if it stands a chance, must follow a different path.
But Eurasian integration will fail if Russia’s partners see the process as Moscow’s attempt at political domination.
In the West, Putin’s best-remembered statement about the Soviet Union described its end as the “greatest catastrophe of the twentieth century.”
Without intellectual property protection, incentives to engage in certain types of creative endeavors would be weakened.
But there are high costs associated with intellectual property.
Consider a drug based on traditional knowledge, say, of an herb well known for its medicinal properties.
How important is the contribution of the American firm that isolates the active ingredient?
Intellectual property is important, but the appropriate intellectual-property regime for a developing country is different from that for an advanced industrial country.
Besides, an international organization already exists to protect intellectual property.
He also likes to say that, though there is an intelligence behind their design, this does not mean that the design is in any sense wise.
It does not mean that the design is smart or optimal.
After World War II, it was again government that led the redesign of the US economy.
The question is how, and whether the design will be in any sense wise.
Let us hope that the looming debate goes well.
International Economic Strategy after September 11
In February 2000, at the request of victims, Senegal indicted and arrested Chad's former dictator Hissene Habre, who had taken refuge there.
Donors should withhold all non-humanitarian aid to Belgrade until it surrenders Milosevic for trial in The Hague.
Are all interpretations equally valid?
I can answer that question only in my own area expertise, economics.
No spin can alter this fact.
America has not turned the corner.
But more important than assessing blame is correcting mistakes.
Golden Slumbers
The price would rise today because everyone had become convinced that it would rise even further tomorrow.
Some are targeting the psychologically compelling $1,000 barrier.
Of course, we do not have annual data for Babylonian gold prices.
Moreover, a certain educational grounding (such as knowledge of Latin or Greek) was necessary to make sense of most cultural objects.
Listeners to popular music need not ``earn'' their aesthetic experience through participation.
Here is the triumph of ``mood over morals.''
This process is most advanced in the US for a number of reasons.
Globalization, which often appears as the triumph of cultural standardization, in reality undermines standardization.
Three issues stand out.
All of this is relevant to today's crisis.
But it is the first word.
There is also the question of whether anything in the texture of Iraqi society can serve as a foundation on which to establish the constitution of liberty in the Tigris/Euphrates valley.
Our Commission released its findings on December 20th.
“So what else is new?” you may ask – and with good reason.
Invocatio Dei and the European Constitution
Constitutionally, European nations display characteristic richness.
The preamble has a binary choice: yes to God, no to God.
Why is excluding a reference to God any more neutral than including God?
The state has changed, and the church has changed even more.
We could also add a third, related, question: are Latin America’s governments preparing for that day?
There are objective reasons for this change.

Iran - a Land of Paradoxes
Among them:
Women can vote and participate actively and publicly in political life.
Iran is also internally divided.
Turkey can be a good neighbor, but otherwise Iran is bordered by inhospitable states to the east and the north.
Iran, after all, is not building an Islamic bomb.
Iran: One Year Later
They lack organization and strategy.
PRINCETON – To Western eyes, Middle East politics have again been stood on their head.
Erdoğan was initially a hero to those same crowds.
Most important, in a world that at least pays lip service to democracy, the voice of “the people” matters.
Recall that the Occupy Wall Street protesters in 2011 took over lower Manhattan for two full months.
Or a three-dimensional image that was actually a picture on a flat surface?
That is true whether an illusion is cognitive or political.
Depending on how a particular event develops, it can lead us to formulate erroneous interpretations of what is actually happening.
The NAM played an important role during the Cold War.
Iran\u0027s Debate Over Iraq
By and large, conservative forces in Iran support this approach.
This view is widely held among Iran's reformers--both inside and outside government--and the more internationally minded technocratic and business class.
God and Woman in Iran
But no woman had previously been nominated for such an honor, and Emperor Franz Joseph refused to bestow the award upon one.
Last year, women made up 60% of all students passing university exams, and women have done well in traditionally male-dominated disciplines like engineering.
Atheists, agnostics, or members of Iran’s Bahai community are not accepted.
It was the “culture” of apartheid South Africa that blacks should live apart from whites and have separate, and inferior, educational opportunities.
Or, to put it more accurately, it was the culture of the whites who held power in these places at that time.
The country’s rulers are all male and Muslim.
There are such differences, and they are not purely physical.
It may be that more men than women want to be engineers.
In November 2009, the Iranian Central Bank (Bank Markazi) reported a 22% annual rise in the price level.
To spur investment, new measures have been undertaken to allow foreign banks to enter the Iranian financial system.
Many have applied, but no license has yet been granted.
The market share of state-owned banks is 85%.
These internal conflicts have worsened with the country’s domestic political crisis and the global economic crisis.
Irrationality seems to have taken over.
But it will clearly be more dangerous for the regime if it does nothing than if it starts to open up what is now a closed and rotting system.
Iran’s Hardline Choice
The regime played its hand brilliantly.
Ahmadinejad is a representative of the younger activists in the anti-Shah revolution of a quarter-century ago.
Iran is already sending many agents into Iraq and supporting clients seeking to turn that country into a clone.
But, with Ahmadinejad, a high level of appeasement will be necessary for even the most minimal diplomatic process to continue.
But how can a lengthy negotiation be carried out without seeming to benefit the party, which wants to gain more time?
Political optics – that is, the management of public perceptions – will be a very important part of this negotiation.
Indeed, the one act most likely to guarantee that Iran obtains nuclear weapons would be to attack it.
On the conservative side, Ahmadinejad so far stands alone.
Iran’s main diplomatic challenge will center on its nuclear program and relations with the United States.
But now he has ostensibly resurfaced, like a Persian Cincinnatus, to help Iran in its hour of need.
The two were often at odds over economic, social, and religious policies.
Indeed, Iran may already be enriching uranium secretly.
The dangers of allowing Iran to go nuclear ought to be obvious.
Even to El-Baradei.
It was light from heaven.
Ahmadinejad related his otherworldly experience in a videotaped meeting with a prominent Ayatollah in Tehran.
Iran’s Options
Only the US can give the Islamic Republic the security guarantees it craves.
But Iran must do its part to make any future dialogue with the US a success.
The last decades have provided the regime with near-ideal conditions to seize control over the Shiite clerical establishment in Iraq as well.
Indeed, growing Iranian control of the Shiite clerical establishment extended beyond Iraq.
Iran’s Pre-Emptive Strike
That meant avoiding a war with Israel.
Iran’s Rattling Saber
While inside, they seized documents and set others alight, and took six embassy employees hostage.
It was only much later that the crowd came under police control and the hostages were set free.
Thirty-two years after the Islamic Republic was established, Iran’s tactics are obvious to everyone.
The so-called students are members of the Basij militia, which was ordered to attack the embassy, with the police only pretending to stop them.
This is not the first time that a European or British embassy has been attacked by the Basij.
But the stakes are higher now than ever before.
Obviously, Revolutionary Guard commanders will not divulge what the new strategy is.
Iran’s Republic of Fear
This view was not invented by Khamenei, but rather is drawn from the Koran and the Shiite tradition.
Thus, external forces do not appear to pose much of a threat.
Fear is a cornerstone of the republic.
It is like a seesaw: Khamenei’s domestic weakness changes the balance of Iran’s foreign policy.
Bureaucratic and security services dominated by the Revolutionary Guards and its militia, the Basij (Mobilization Corps), are now firmly in command.
The leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, blessed the Revolutionary Guards’ decision to steal the presidential election.
Iran’s Supreme Power Struggle
But public diplomacy is not diplomacy itself.
Iran is also reaping the returns of long-term investments.
The loss of Damascus would cost Iran its influence in Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine in one fell swoop.
Indeed, in Mashad on March 21, Ayatollah Khamenei said, “There were some rumors that I support a special candidate for the presidential elections.
But I have one vote, and I would not determine a certain candidate because the people themselves should choose their candidates based on their own knowledge.”
So how will the Iranian people weigh their votes?
With the voting age set at just 16 years, Iran has roughly 48 million eligible voters.
They are more educated, more urbanized, and more internationally oriented than previous generations.
More of them are university educated, and, of this group, a majority is female.
Age, not social class, will determine the outcome of June’s election. 
Like all Iranians, younger voters are focused on economic issues, particularly the difficult combination of high inflation and high unemployment.
But Qalibaf still has not taken the plunge.
Our Iranian problem is actually a problem with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC, or in Persian Pasdaran) and allied institutions like the Basij militia.
If it was difficult to evacuate and supply a small city like New Orleans, how would New York or Los Angeles fare?
The floodwaters will recede in New Orleans and reconstruction will begin.
Iraq: More than an American Problem
Terrorism bred in Iraq will not stay there.
Turkey, for example, is poised to attack the Kurdish enclave in Iraq’s north.
Such a conflict would threaten the vital flow of oil from the Middle East to the rest of the world.
It posted an anti-war petition with over 1,000 signatories, mostly academics.
But others supported Yu Jie's critique.
Although the surface of this debate is about America and Iraq, the subtext, as always, concerns China.
"A modern sovereign state, first and foremost, bases itself on the recognition of individual rights and democracy," according to Wang Yi, a liberal scholar.
As the war progressed, pro-war voices increasingly fell silent.
Iraq and Japanese Isolation
That tendency remains dominant.
That alliance enabled Japan to help defeat Russia in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905).
In the light of this history, how should Japan's stance in Iraq be viewed?
In today’s Iraq, there is no peace and no prosperity.
For example, the age of sexual consent for girls cannot be set above nine, because Muhhamad himself had a nine-year-old wife.
Iraq’s Critical Election
Moreover, as United States troops have lowered their profile, daily violence of the more random variety has increased.
The prime minister then met with Iraq’s chief justice, following which the court’s decision was reversed.
There will be several ways to gauge the election’s relative success.
That includes not only those who have been banned from running for office, but others as well.
Day or night, they live in darkness.
Will democracy stop men from beating their wives?
They fall easily into violence, theft, and sabotage.
We must not use no-work jobs to disguise an army of unemployed.
Iraq’s Half Step
This is an important distinction.
In the future, especially without Sistani, who is 74 years old, the new regime could turn into a dictatorship.
Already, the reform movement has changed the debate in the Arab world, but it still faces a long road ahead.
That case is not yet proven.
The Iraqi election was an important half-step in that direction.
The employees of the state-owned enterprises still receive paychecks, even though about a third of their workplaces have been destroyed.
They can earn more hanging around with a gun in their hands than by working in construction or trade.
Worse still, it is now clear that Bush never had a plan for when the war ended.
But can any such government administer the country as a whole?
The impact of this state of affairs can hardly be overestimated.
But this stability will face new challenges in 2006.
This devastation is even more dramatic because, since the invasion four years ago, only 3,183 Iraqis have been resettled in third countries.
Indeed, this is the largest population displacement in the Middle East since 1948.
The country had a total population of 26.8 million, and now nearly 13% of them are displaced; many may never return.
Most of those to whom I spoke were poor and without hope for the future.
None wanted me to use their names.
If the Parliament in Baghdad, one of the best protected buildings in the country, can be attacked from within, then no Zone in Iraq is Green; they are all Red.
Horror stories of all types have emerged in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein.
Saddam's regime was largely successful in suppressing information about the event. 
The risk was that the seed might grow moldy during the long, humid ocean transport to Iraq if it was not dressed with some fungicide.
So it took another couple of months before the grain reached the farmers.
By then the sowing season was long over.
Like farmers all over the world, Iraqi farmers mistrust their government.
At first, doctors initially had no idea as to the cause.
A small group of international experts on mercury were called in.
I went as a World Health Organization staff member.
But what food had been contaminated?
Bread could be and sometimes was.
As grain was fed to chicken, sheep, and cows, meat, milk, cheese, and butter became contaminated.
Farmers were ordered to hand over all remaining supplies within a fortnight.
But most farmers had no access to radio, television, or daily newspapers.
Fish soon became contaminated, as did migratory birds.
At hospitals throughout the country, doctors concluded that there was nothing they could do.
There is no real treatment for methyl mercury poisoning.
Now the story can be told.
Iraq’s Silent Dead
America’s public reaction has been as remarkable as the Lancet study, for the reaction has been no reaction.
The issue of civilian deaths was not even raised.
It does not.
Avoiding that outcome presupposes a strong political center.
Ireland Decides, Again
For the EU, the stakes could not be higher.
The hubris of the Celtic Tiger years is a distant memory, owing to the worst recession in Ireland’s history as an independent state.
Government ministers and EU representatives repeatedly cite the example of Iceland in pointing out what might have happened to Ireland if it had been outside the EU.
But the picture is far from clear-cut.
Ireland’s Moment of Fiscal Decision
DUBLIN – “The construction of Europe is an art,” former French President Jacques Chirac once said.
“It is the art of the possible.”
Finally, in December, decisive action was taken.
The treaty would promote stability in the Irish economy and contribute to stabilizing the euro, our currency.
It would increase confidence in Ireland and allow us to increase the existing flow of inward foreign direct investment.
We are highly regarded around the world as an excellent export base.
Global companies recognize that, as the only English-speaking member of the eurozone, Ireland is ideally placed as a gateway to Europe.
Crucially, we are also a member of the second-largest currency area in the world.
These companies spend €16 billion per year on goods, services, and wages in Ireland.
We spoke about European Monetary Union, but we didn’t have it.
Irish recovery cannot occur without European recovery.
Ireland\u0027s Second, and Last, Chance
Forgotten what that treaty is all about?
This sort of thinking is the surest way to block enlargement.
There is an important parallel to this situation: in 1992, Danes surprisingly voted No to the Maastricht Treaty.
The Irish are in the same position now.
It is up them to say Yes or No to the Treaty of Nice.
The percentage of “Don’t knows” remains high, at about 47%, so there is everything to play for in the campaign’s final days.
Like other young people around them, they want to be the agents of their own destiny.
The basic texts remain the same, but their interpretation, and the application of religion in people’s lives, has not.
It is in this context that the debate about gene doping erupted during the 2004 Olympics in Athens.
Again, regulation ought not to rely on one single global authority.
If we don’t ban gene transfer in the first place, then on one level, it is not cheating.
They should begin by imagining what would happen if the child of a genetically modified human wanted to become an elite athlete.
Is Academic Freedom Worth Its Price?
WARWICK, UK – Is academic freedom affordable in a time of economic crisis?
But universities also have an institutional mandate to teach.
In the process, the larger public – those not involved in the original production of new knowledge – benefit through classroom instruction.
The autonomy of these orders rested on a proven long-term ability to do more than expected with what they were given.
In these ways, academics enable knowledge to do maximum work at minimal cost to its recipients.
Might the same thing happen again?
They criticized the situation.
Is America an Empire?
English is a lingua franca like Latin.
The US economy is the largest in the world, and American culture serves as a magnet.
But it is a mistake to confuse primacy with empire.
Devotees of the New Imperialism would say, "Don't to be so literal."
After all, "empire" is merely a metaphor.
NEWPORT BEACH – Six internal factors suggest that the United States’ economy is slowly healing.
The third and fourth positive factors relate to housing and the labor market.
Is Azerbaijan Next?
But can such a scheme work in Azerbaijan?
But the authorities may have the upper hand.
Such an image may be less valid in Azerbaijan.
But will such restrictions work?
Before instituting such invasive regulation, we should examine whether past compensation structures really were the catalysts for our recent problems.
Entertainers and athletes appeal to larger audiences.
By the standards of what is generally understood today, he will do a good job.
In the US, consumer prices fell 27% between 1929 and 1933, and the unemployment rate topped out in 1933 at 23%.
But the study also found important differences.
In contrast, US home prices were uneventful before the Great Depression, and actually fell slightly in real terms between 1925 and 1929.
In contrast, real oil prices were flat leading up to 1929, and down nearly 50% in real terms from the 1925-6 “fuel folly” peaks.
He might find himself pushing on a string.
In those circumstances, the violence is not imminent, and it is carried out by those offended by the speaker’s views rather than by sympathizers.
And, of course, it is typically carried out directly on the speaker.
Is Bush Right?
But for how long?
A month?
Four months?
Three years?
A sharp spike in US casualties would compound the pressure to get out.
Is Capitalism Doomed?
Nor could monetary policy help very much.
Is Central Bank Independence All It’s Cracked up to Be?
One such moment was the stock market crash of 1987.
Such fundamental issues cannot be relegated to technocrats, particularly when those technocrats place the interests of one segment of society above others.
Is China Cheating?
How else, says the US, could China undercut American producers in so many areas?
By and large, America now has a relative disadvantage in manufacturing, while China has a relative advantage.
They interfere with markets when it suits their purposes.
Is China Closing or Opening?
Why not just keep the fledgling epidemic under wraps and hope that it goes away without the world ever knowing?
In 1800, Asia represented more than half of global population and output.
Asia’s recovery began with Japan, then moved to South Korea and on to Southeast Asia, beginning with Singapore and Malaysia.
In 2010, China passed Japan to become the world’s second largest economy.
Moreover, linear projections of economic growth trends can be misleading.
China’s north and east have outpaced its south and west.
Indeed, China’s 12th Five-Year Plan is aimed at reducing dependence on exports and boosting domestic demand.
Will it work?
Is China Really Immune to the Crisis?
But there is a catch.
The environmental degradation is obvious even to casual observers.
This is not to say that the US and China are the same.
Is China’s Economy Overheating?
It would thus appear that there is nothing wrong with China continuing to buy new equipment, build new factories, and construct new roads and bridges as fast as its can.
Whatever one calls it, it is a problem.
The latter group includes extractive- and construction-related companies operating in partnership with the government of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) itself.
Is China Strong or Weak?
Chinese spokesmen denounced this as a throwback to the days when America thought it could, and should, try to “contain” the People’s Republic.
But the Party remains in charge today.
Airport bookstores that once displayed Gordon G. Chang’s The Coming Collapse of China now offer Martin Jacques’ When China Rules the World.
SINGAPORE – The Chinese are everywhere.
As the two institutions responsible for all Chinese overseas financing, they are making waves around the world.
Confucius Institutes are sprouting from Sri Lanka to Nigeria to promote the study of Mandarin.
This model entails exporting to other parts of the world primary products and natural resources such as agricultural produce or minerals.
The problem for poor countries is that they are not producing the right kinds of goods.
What poor nations get out of Chinese mercantilism is, at best, temporary growth of the wrong kind.
After all, there was nothing very cold about the Cold War in Asia.
Sun Tzu, the great Chinese theorist of warfare, focused on the weakening of an adversary psychologically, not in battle.
So the challenge that China poses today remains predominantly political and economic, not military.
Is Democracy Possible in the Arab World?
Are they right?
At the same time, the Middle East is awash with modern communications, much of it with an anti-Western slant.
Germany and Japan were, indeed, postwar success stories.
Corporations, foundations, universities, and other non-profit organizations can promote much of this work.
But governments also have an important role to play.
In these cirumstances, neither Syria nor Iran seems capable of delivering anything but mayhem in Iraq.
The story gets more complicated when one considers the UN inquiry into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.
Assad cannot turn his back on all of this.
There is now a regular season for discussing drugs in sports, one that arrives every year with the Tour de France.
This year, the overall leader, two other riders, and two teams were expelled or withdrew from the race as a result of failing, or missing, drug tests.
In the United States, the debate has been fueled by the baseball player Barry Bonds’ march towards the all-time record for home runs in a career.
Bonds is widely believed to have been helped by drugs and synthetic hormones.
So, if an athlete has a dangerously high level of red blood cells as a result of taking erythropoietin (EPO), he or she should not be allowed to compete.
The issue is the red blood cell count, not the means used to elevate it.
Setting a maximum level of red blood cells actually levels the playing field by reducing the impact of the genetic lottery.
Effort then becomes more important than having the right genes.
Some argue that taking drugs is “against the spirit of sport.”
The World Anti-Doping Code no longer prohibits caffeine.
In any case, performance-enhancement is, Savulescu says, the very spirit of sport.
We should allow athletes to pursue it by any safe means.
Moreover, I would argue that sport has no single “spirit.”
Physical exercise makes people not only healthier, but also happier.
The problem is not with the athletes, but with us.
And no matter how blatant the drug use may be, we don’t stop watching the Tour de France.
Maybe we should just turn off the television and get on our own bikes.
And, in an age of mass air travel, a case in Tajikistan can be in Utah in a day.
More broadly, the ECB’s marginal lending facility is an indirect means of monetizing sovereign debt.
But it works.
The acute crisis is over, at least for now.
These commodities, after all, are priced in US dollars.
The recent election in Italy of a center-left government led by Romano Prodi is a case in point.
It is now out of power.
Is Europe Turning Toward A Strong Euro?
These commodities, after all, are priced in US dollars.
The recent election in Italy of a center-left government led by Romano Prodi is a case in point.
Now it is out of power.
We should learn more at next week’s June meeting.
But for how long?
So exporting will become an even tougher business.
But the impact will extend beyond the surplus countries.
That means that roughly 1.3 million more people will be employed in America in 2009, 1.9 million more in 2010, and 0.7 million people employed in 2011.
It is as if he has not done his own arithmetic.
But this is like looking for one’s lost keys under the lamppost because the light is better there.
In that case, our social profit is not $210 billion but rather $390 billion, and we should certainly do this again.
It continued last fall with the wave of violence in the suburbs.
Since the French Revolution, the imperative of equality has often triumphed over the concern for liberty.
In truth, however, other than reflecting the French preference for the politics of the street, the two phenomena have nothing in common.
Certainly not.
Is Free Trade With the US Right for Central America?
That figure can grow only to 1.4% over the next 15 years.
This will force small and medium producers to become more competitive, but they must do so on an uneven playing field.
The trouble is that Central America relies on third countries for knit fabrics.
So why did Central America's leaders sign the agreement?
The fight for democracy cannot be selective.
The cost in interrupted growth and unemployment has been intolerably large.
The possibilities include:
This equation is too facile.
Education.
What should a government's priorities be in its education budget?
Corruption.
Public health.
Industrial strategy.
Of course, none of this would be bad if openness were the key to growth.
Alas, evidence for a link between a country's trade barriers and its growth rate is weak.
Strategic use of international trade and capital flows is part of a development strategy; it should not be a substitute for it.
CAMBRIDGE – As I walked through the airport in Dubai recently, I was struck by the large number of travelers who were buying gold coins.
The short answer is no on all counts.
A dollar was worth 200 yen in 1980.
Is Goodness Natural?
Then a solution to this nasty conundrum hit Darwin like a ton of bricks.
Blood relatives are, by definition, very similar to one another.
By helping your blood relatives, you are indirectly promoting the reproduction of copies of your own genes - copies that just happen to reside inside your kin. 
Instead, what is now known as “Hamilton’s Rule” states that altruism evolves whenever r times b is greater than c.
If goodness is a problem, then the answer – or at the least part of the answer – can be found in evolutionary biology.
That is the easy part.
If Brown offers more of the same, he will lose.
First, the total volume of JGBs has become extremely high relative to households’ net monetary assets, which stand at roughly ¥1,100 trillion.
Such management is possible.
The question goes to the heart of democracy.
Consider, for example, that prince of ambiguity, the Duc de Talleyrand.
Let us identify the various types.
Another type is the well-meaning dilettante.
The gambler's close kin is the political "troublemaker," who pursues his soaring ambitions by any means necessary, whatever the risks and regardless of the cost to others.
But things are not that simple.
Immanuel Kant described two types of politicians.
It is a label that easily applies to all the types of dishonest politicians described above.
I am a political practitioner, first and foremost.
Instead, we have a special deficit with regard to our explanatory understandings.
Several factors converge to create this illusion of knowledge.
The more parts you can see, the more you think you know how those parts actually work.
The government is still lagging on its domestic economic reforms.
Is Inequality Inhibiting Growth?
The alternative narrative has more to say.
Is Inflation Returning?
But, unlike private investors, Fed officials insist that this time really will be different.
The unusual nature of current unemployment increases the risk of future inflation still further.
So, the prescription goes, why not generate higher inflation for a while?
Inflation would clearly make creditors worse off.
Who are they?
I see the left as being correct – this time – in the global economy’s post-industrial North Atlantic core.
The American Employment Cost index and other indicators of developed-country nominal wage growth show no acceleration of change.
But these are not normal times.
Is Iraq Safe Yet?
Is Israel a Normal Country?
The killing of nine civilians by those commandoes was a terrible consequence.
The bloodlust of an African or Asian people is not taken as seriously that of a European – or other white – people.
After all, some might say (and many more might think), what can one expect from savages?
They don’t know any better.
As was true of Apartheid-era South Africa, Israel reminds people of the sins of Western imperialism.
All of this suggests a tectonic shift in Japan's military thinking.
But Koizumi is behaving in accordance with a deep-rooted tradition in Japan, one that long precedes the attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in December 1941.
Indeed, next year is the centenary of the Russo-Japanese War.
To understand what is happening militarily in Japan today, there is no better approach than to examine the soul of the Japanese state one hundred years ago.
By 1904, Japan had already fought a one-sided, eight-month campaign against China.
Russia coveted Port Arthur, and the powers jointly brought pressure on Japan to withdraw from the Treaty of Shimonoseki.
Russia also coveted Korea and Manchuria.
What, they asked, could Russia possibly fear from ``yellow monkeys''?
With a diplomatic resolution ruled out, Japan launched a preemptive strike that annihilated the Russian Fleet in Port Arthur and Chemulpo, Korea.
But the peace treaty agreed at Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1905 (brokered by President Theodore Roosevelt) hardly reflected this.
Is Keynesian Economics Dead?
In the future, even liquid markets will be willing to intermediate fewer transactions than they were two months ago.
So will companies, both multinationals and Chinese, leave for Vietnam, Bangladesh, or Mozambique?
Is Mexico Disintegrating?
While the Obama administration is obviously aware of what is happening south of the Rio Grande, the threat simply does not command the attention that its gravity requires.
Soon after, a hit man murdered Edgar Milan Gomez, Mexico’s highest-ranking Federal police official.
In November, 2008, a plane carrying Juan Camilo Mourino, Mexico’s national security advisor, crashed under mysterious circumstances.
This is the way Mexico policy has been run for decades.
Their point of reference is the 1973 war, which helped to bring about peace between Egypt and Israel.
The Arab states are aware of this.
The Obama administration has had a strong start with respect to the Middle East.
And the European Union?
And sometimes they are released violently.
Of 226 significant armed conflicts between 1945 and 2002, less than half in the 1950’s were fought between states and armed groups.
By the 1990’s, such conflicts were the dominant form.
The result is what General Sir Rupert Smith, the former British commander in Northern Ireland and the Balkans, calls “war among the people.”
This leads to a larger point about the role of military force in world politics.
The Washington Treaty was signed half a century ago to meet the Soviet threat at the Cold War's outset.
Britain and a number of European NATO allies, including France, Italy and even Germany, quickly offered to provide military forces.
But the US has been patently reluctant to accept the help offered by France, Germany and Italy.
The fifth conclusion is that this crisis may have seriously damaged efforts to create a common foreign and security policy between members of the European Union.
Then came the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
But genuine realism, unfortunately, is beside the point.
Most have refused.
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain, in particular, perceive Iran as inciting unrest among their own substantial Shia populations.
Is Peru Next?
But Humala is hardly a saint.
The United States is also concerned.
In fact, Humala has singled out Chilean contracts and investments as targets for revision.
Flores, by contrast, offers legal security for businessmen and investors.
We now know that porn delivers rewards to the male brain in the form of a short-term dopamine boost, which, for an hour or two afterwards, lifts men’s mood and makes them feel good in general.
The neural circuitry is identical to that for other addictive triggers, such as gambling or cocaine.
Is Psychiatry Stuck in the Past?
Yet psychiatry continues to inhabit medicine's netherworld - within the mainstream clinically, outside it scientifically. 
Of course, computer programs can now process data derived from patients' symptoms and generate psychiatric diagnoses.
From the 1950's to 1980's, for example, psychoanalysis held sway among US psychiatrists.
But the psychoanalytic approach, with its reliance on personal interaction with patients, led to a broad conception of pathology.
In 1987, political pressure in the US led to the elimination of homosexuality as a diagnosis from the nationally accepted guidelines.
LONDON – Relationships between London banks and their regulators are not especially warm just now.
Of course, regulatory staff had more informal links with the industry than with consumers.
Is it effective?
Turnover among senior – and not so senior – people in these agencies is very high.
Singapore and Hong Kong have a different model.
In May 1972, when the United States returned the Okinawa Prefecture to Japan, the transfer included the Senkaku Islands, which the US had administered from Okinawa.
No one wants to return to the 1930’s.”
Undergraduate enrollment of Japanese students in US universities has fallen by more than 50% since 2000.
MOSCOW – Has Russia’s economic crisis ended?
Then there is another “miracle” that the government is starting to trumpet, one discovered in August 2009: an increase in Russia’s population.
The truth, it is clear, is somewhere in the middle.
What is beyond dispute is that Russia’s economic health depends on external factors.
But that is wrong.
The situation at carmaker AUTOVaz is a striking example.
Last year, output fell to 300,000 cars, from 800,000 in 2008.
Yet, of the company’s 102,000 employees, only 27 favored layoffs.
The state, which is seeking to rescue the domestic automobile industry, allocated to the firm more credits through state-owned banks.
But how long can such a situation last?
Is Russia Weak?
Is it not a contribution to international security?
Russia has not been the only beneficiary of its activities in the Caucasus, especially since 2000.
Rather, it is a demand for a fair international legal order.
These are all global, not local, issues.
Sprawled over 11 time zones between the EU and the US, of which five border China, it is impossible to expect Russia to remain merely a regional power.
It is based on the possibility of a free life in a secure environment – something that Americans take for granted.
Even primates display physiological and behavioral signs after losses that are unmistakably similar to sadness among humans.
Is Speculating on Food Dangerous?
Indeed, only 2% of contracts end in the delivery of the physical commodity.
Thus, the market also attracts investors who are not interested in the commodity, but in speculative gain.
In fact, commodity futures have become increasingly appealing to non-commercial investors, as their returns seem to be negatively correlated with returns on equities and bonds.
Recent initiatives by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission point in the right direction.
The key question now concerns the order in which these outcomes occur.
This will raise actual output to the level of potential output, thereby closing the output gap.
Some $584 billion is allocated for 2009-2010, leaving perhaps $300 billion of extra money for this year.
This can be illustrated by a simple example.
Let’s subtract 20% for these two items.
Indeed, Syria has long been included on the US State Department's list of nations that support terrorism.
Because the country's rulers include many members of his team, such a possibility probably exists.
But are the Americans willing to see it?
When the regime cracks down on the Internet, people use proxy servers.
But Syria will change, and I, like my compatriots, pray that when change comes, it is peaceful and harmonious.
Is the Boss Overpaid?
No manager is a superstar, a Tiger Woods or Michael Schumacher of the boardroom.
The question is not specific to France.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Department of Justice apparently decided to fight the “backdating” practices, which where especially common in Silicon Valley.
European integration has been compared to a bicycle that must be moved forward, because otherwise it falls to the ground.
But correcting this will become harder after new members have joined. 
So, as enlargement approaches, the EU faces a cross roads.
Certainly, political union and a common market require a uniform frame of reference to prevent major distortions in competition.
But increased heterogeneity in a Union of 27 requires a more flexible institutional framework.
Neither does European ``public opinion.''
But preparedness to surrender national sovereignty to the Union varies between EU member countries.
That is why the prize has invited comparisons to an Oscar lifetime achievement award that comes only when the recipient is nearing death.
The decision to establish the EU was an ingenious response to the biggest challenge of the day – war and conflict.
Meanwhile, with some exceptions – most notably Finland – Europe has slipped into riding in the peloton.
Germany , Europe’s largest exporter, has a very large trade surplus with the rest of the world.
The eurozone provides the only large capital market other than the US for such investments.
Malta, too, has a deficit close to 10% of GDP, up four percentage points since 2001.
Throughout Central and Eastern Europe, the EU is not as popular as it used to be.
Voter turnout in the European Parliament elections in June was embarrassingly low in the new accession countries, ranging from just 17% in Slovakia to 38.5% in Hungary.
The reasons are twofold.
Is the Market Moral?
Being a member of a guild, for example, encompassed a complete set of social roles--economic, legal, political, and even religious.
Inflation came down rapidly, from more than 10% in 1981 to less than 4% in 1983, because Reagan backed the tough monetary policies of US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.
Today an inflation rate of close to zero is the accepted goal of US policy.
When Margaret Thatcher became prime minister of Britain in 1979, she faced an economy with much more fundamental problems than those in the US.
Moreover, trade restrictions in China and India remain among the highest in the world.
Meanwhile, serious trade reform did not start until 1991-93.
Even there, you will find a residue of the intellectual sloppiness that the World Bank has displayed on this issue in the past.
One wonders why not.
What's at issue is the policy conclusion to be drawn from this empirical observation.
The term "bubble" is widely used but rarely defined.
The increase in housing prices during the 1980's is now viewed as the veritable model of a boom cycle turned bust.
For the vast majority, investment was either "a major consideration" or at least "in part" a motive for buying.
Thus, conditions would appear to be consistent with a bubble, though less so than in the 1980's.
The US is hardly alone.
In France, Italy, and Belgium, the ratio is close to its long-term average, and in Spain, the Netherlands, and Ireland, it is 40-50% above it.
Australian household debt over the past decade has soared from 55% to 130% of personal disposable income.
Or did I take my European linkage for granted?
They do not call themselves Europeans.
A fourth great task lies ahead.
The question at hand could not have been more important.
Also gone are the cookie cutter policy recommendations unaffected by contextual differences.
Foreign economists and aid agencies can supply some of the ingredients, but only the country itself can provide the recipe.
If there is a new Washington consensus, it is that the rulebook must be written at home, not in Washington.
In India, although only 53% say that women have gained greater equality, an additional 14% say that women now have more rights than men!
In Iran, the figures were 82% and 78%, respectively. 
Openly racist ideas prevailed in Germany and the American South, and much of the world’s population lived in colonies ruled by European powers.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about equal rights for women.
This may mean that the surveys I have quoted indicate not widespread equality, but widespread hypocrisy.
Is This Really War?
The place to start is Ukraine.
Half of Ukraine’s population is Russian-speaking in various degrees.
UEFA is unhappy with Ukraine’s progress in building the necessary infrastructure, but Ukraine should be given time to get its act together.
Ukraine faces a crucial presidential election in 2009 or 2010 (and Moldova will hold elections in March 2009).
Islam as a Tool of Modernization
But Malaysian history over the past three decades shows that this belief is mistaken.
Partly in response to this challenge, Anwar was sacked. 
This trend continues.
I believe that Huntington is wrong on both counts.
Sir V. S. Naipaul, recently awarded the Nobel Prize for literature, once wrote an article entitled ``Our Universal Civilization.''
Naipaul is, after all, an author of Indian descent who grew up in Trinidad.
John Locke's ``Second Discourse on Government'' begins with a long polemic against Robert Filmer's argument for the divine right of kings.
The final source of rights is nature.
Sheik Dia al-Shakarchi, a leading Shi’ite theologian, argues that democracy is not only compatible with Islam, but is essential to it.
The first is secular dictatorship.
We have considerable experience of this in the Middle East.
Such a dictatorship would damage Islam by associating Islam with unjust rule and creating enemies for Islam.
A beneficial Islamic doctrine is the Koranic injunction that "there shall be no compulsion in matters of religion."
Islam’s Forsaken Renaissance
The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, brought one – and only one – religion.
But what is it that we must believe when each branch of Islam thinks the other one is wrong?
The Koran, after all, is one book, not two or three, or a thousand.
One learned religious teacher, for example, refused to believe that a man had landed on the moon.
In the past, Muslims were strong because they were learned.
Indeed, there was no “Muslim scholarship” at the time, so to read meant to read whatever was available.
The early Muslims read the works of the great Greek scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers. They also studied the works of the Persians, the Indians, and the Chinese.
The result was a flowering of science and mathematics.
The result was intellectual regression at the very moment that Europe began embracing scientific and mathematical knowledge.
But would Turkey be Muslim today without Ataturk?
Islam\u0027s Reformist Tradition
Out of the spotlight, countless Muslim scholars and academics have continued to probe the connections between Islamic thought and modern values.
All of this helped rally Malaysia's Chinese community to his side.
Recent books published in the West reflect this, with titles like What is Islam? , What Does It Mean To Be A Muslim? , and How To Experience Islam?
It is easy to fast during Ramadan in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Egypt, even if one does not want to.
The forms of religiosity in Islam today are more or less the same as those found in Catholicism, Protestantism, and even Judaism.
Why ban kites?
Why risk burning in hell for a kite?
Better to ban them.
The French police arrested a German citizen with a Polish name in connection with the terrorist attack on the synagogue in Djerba, Tunisia.
The radical and violent left in Europe today has abandoned these zones of social exclusion.
Islamicizing Malaysia
All attempts to reduce Malay influence serve to mobilize this community – in both ethnic and religious terms.
Malay politicians have learned how to play this card very effectively.
As a result, many Malay-Muslims increasingly worry about the loss of familiar economic and political safeguards.
Islands of Isolation
Perhaps geography is destiny.
In reality, both remain mostly inward looking and preoccupied with the disintegration of their original culture.
Of course, Norway has the world’s highest per capita income.
The Edo nostalgia in Japan and the Norway model’s appeal in the UK are not rational choices.
Islands of Nationalism
In the medium term, the two governments should work out a formula for coping with scenarios that now play out regularly.
Israel after Goldstone
Or so it should be.
Regular armies are no longer the exclusive threat to countries’ security.
The Goldstone report is not necessarily bad news for peace prospects in the Middle East.
I was visiting Israel as Australia’s foreign minister to argue the case for rapid implementation of the Oslo peace accords – all the way through to negotiated acceptance of Palestinian statehood.
Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert came close, but not close enough.
This serves the interests of both sides.
Morocco, Algeria, and Libya are hardly partners for such regional cooperation, which is also the case for most Arab countries in the Middle East.
Both sides seem eager to expand the scope of their partnership, with the objective of  reaching a high level of interoperability.
Israel and Palestine After Oslo
The Oslo Accords divided the occupied territories into three regions.
As a result, without a clear agreement on borders, Area C will witness the most serious confrontations.
Nor did they come like the American or Australian settlers in order to build a new identity and assimilate the natives into it. 
There must be a clear border between the two.
Israel’s Centrist Victory
JERUSALEM – Israel’s election is a victory for centrism and national consensus.
From experience, most Israelis have developed a worldview that combines traditional left-wing and right-wing thinking.
Both the left and the right have been proven wrong.
The same applies to Syria.
PARIS – What is wrong with Israel?
Where should one look for an explanation for this tragic evolution?
This is not true of Israel.
Israel is too small to act foolishly.
Israel’s Debacle at Sea
Not all Israelis share this logic.
The US had two requirements of Mubarak: that he undertake domestic political reform, and that he be a peace broker in the region.
The real threat to Egypt’s security today is on its southern and eastern borders, not in Israel.
Inertia was not always Israel’s way.
Israel’s Lonely Prosperity
In the opening session, Obama’s special envoy, Denis Ross, was greeted with resounding silence when he conveyed to the participants his boss’s warm wishes.
From Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, luxurious penthouses are multiplying.
Are we in Singapore, Hong Kong, or São Paulo?
But, high on the benefits of globalization, and waiting with a mixture of excitement and apprehension for the coming of a new post-Western world order, Israelis are dancing on the rim of a volcano.
Israel’s Mission
JERUSALEM – Israel is one of the biggest success stories of modern times.
The same tools must be used to end the conflict with the Arab world, in particular with the Palestinians.
The Jews did not survive extermination only to entrench themselves behind walls of their own making.
The country increasingly lives in its own virtual reality, simultaneously proximate to and far removed from the revolutionary pre-modernity of most of its neighbors.
“Red lines” in Israel have a way of mutating into lines drawn in the sand, which are then rendered invisible at the slightest wind.
It has moved into its own orbit.
And, in Israel, fulfilling it will be no small achievement.
At the end of the day, there are only 13.2 million Jews in the world and nearly 1.3 billion Muslims.
These deep Israeli emotions are the product of the encounter between the weight of the past and the “facility” of the present.
In May 2010, Israel responded with a new wrinkle.
It leaked to the London Sunday Times that it had placed nuclear-armed submarines off Iran’s coast.
Time is growing short.
On the surface, party competition has been between “left” and “right,” or “hawks” and “doves.”
Once again, Abbas looked feeble in comparison.
So it was in bombed German cities during World War II; so it was in Vietnam; and so it is turning out to be in Gaza.
Humiliation is not a firm basis for long-term stability.
In contrast to the past, no Israeli border is now secure, especially the long frontier with Egypt.
No implicit alliance can be taken for granted.
Tel Aviv has become a cross between San Francisco, Singapore, and São Paulo, but it is still less than 300 kilometers from Damascus.
Israel’s Wrong Friends
But it is just as true that being a friend of Israel is not necessarily the same thing as being a friend of the Jews.
Richard Nixon, for example, said of Jews that “you can’t trust the bastards,” but was a great admirer of Israel.
And, of course, the last 2,000 years have shown that anti-Semitism is perfectly compatible with the worship of a Jew called Jesus of Nazareth.
In short, the wrong friends of Israel are even worse friends of the Jewish people.
Israel Votes for Violence
The most important element now is the new administration in the United States.
It’s Not Just Russia’s Fault
Loans from western governments to the Soviet Union are at issue.
Western governments acting as the Paris Club in the autumn of 1991 must share the blame.
Will Russia’s official creditors be less blinkered than in 1991-92?
Mountains remain to be climbed.
A land market must be created virtually from scratch.
Europe, Italian-Style
Interest-rate spreads on Italian sovereign debt have widened, but not sharply.
Obviously, in the context of the eurozone, this is not an option.
This process does work in the long run.
Italy’s Return to Political Paralysis
Voters could choose between a left-wing coalition and a right-wing coalition.
One of the last acts of his government was to replace the majoritarian electoral system, introduced in 1993, with proportional rule.
This outcome would be accelerated if, as is likely, Berlusconi himself were to distance himself from politics in the coming electoral term.
Inaction is simply not an option for the new government.
How did this happen?
Everyone is wondering – not least those of us at Yale.
He is surrounded by academics.
There seems to be a pattern.
In fact, Golden worked under Swensen at Yale from 1988 until 1993.
Swensen has written two books about investing, one for professionals and one for the general public.
Yale lets Swensen invest for the very long term, and does not bother him about quarterly performance.
He also has invested in non-traditional asset classes, including real estate, oil, timber, private equity, and venture capital and buyout firms.
Initially, the campaign seemed to succeed.
“I don’t have children of my own,” wrote one, “but reading this makes my heart hurt.”
Another wrote: “If things go on this way, our country doesn’t have a future.”
Not even Americans are exempt.
Having grown up with presidents and presidential candidates tossing around the Bond meme virtually without challenge, they thought I was making things up.
“Of course it’s legal,” they said.
The book No Easy Day, written by a team member, is a bestseller.
His innocent victims, meanwhile, are invisible.
For 50 years, James Bond and his “license to kill” have stood for imperial justice beyond the limits of law.
But he is imaginary, as are his victims.
Buchanan considered such analysis romantic.
Firms have technological, competitive, and bottom-line constraints.
Social Security has helped reduce poverty among the elderly.
Boards on Their Backs
The London Whale is a case in point.
But which huge banking conglomerate has such a lead director today?
The regulators acquiesce because, simply put, they are afraid.
Power corrupts, and financial power corrupts the financial system.
Japan Must End its Silence
Why is Japan so seemingly detached in international affairs?
There is another factor at work, too.
That changed at the recent Asian Football Cup.
At the same time, the ancient sense of cultural superiority that runs in Chinese veins makes feelings of inferiority hard to bear.
So how should Japan respond?
Should Japan fight fire with fire?
More is at stake than maritime interests.
The military core of such a strategy must include appropriate maritime tactics to respond to China's assertiveness.
The Asian Football Cup highlighted not only China's growing nationalism, but also the parlous state of relations with Japan.
Kan became finance minister after his predecessor Hirohisa Fujii suddenly resigned, citing ill health.
Kan ’s international debut was equally inauspicious.
At the G-7 meeting in Canada in February, the focus was on the Greek financial crisis and its international implications.
The meeting, it turns out, was “all Greek” to him.
When Kan led the DPJ in opposition, he avoided discussing any raise in the rate of consumption tax.
The country has laws on the books to handle the matter.
By virtually any measure, official Japanese debt is the highest in the world.
Just as Japan’s deficit is monumental by any measure, Japanese income earners are clearly under-taxed.
Despite its two decades of economic malaise, Japan remains the world’s third-largest economy, and will grow by about 2% this year and 1.5% in 2013.
Japan’s Kamikaze Isolation
The US administration, fashionably worried over China’s growing regional influence, seems quite happy with a closely-tied Japan that could help balance China.
Such a framework can emerge in Asia only with Japan’s active involvement, not on the basis of her isolation.
Japan\u0027s Malaise Was Made In America
The long bureaucratic struggle over whom to name as the next Governor of the Bank of Japan is over.
But this ended after 1985, as the so-called "Plaza Accord" - agreed by the central banks of France, Germany, the UK, the US, and Japan - weakened the dollar by 30%.
Massive yen appreciation led to a Japanese recession in 1985-86, and the BOJ lowered interest rates to near zero.
This was the start of the great Japanese asset-price bubble.
But all bubbles burst.
But the respite was short-lived.
In 1995, Kobe citizens extricated from the rubble were looked after if they belonged to corporations or religious groups.
Unfortunately, today’s Japanese media are overlooking that historical context.
Other possible priorities hardly ever entered political discussions.
Two usual explanations exist for Japan’s poor economic performance.
Political paralysis also contributed to the lack of structural change.
This export-led recovery did not occur in the 1990s.
But a policy like that demands a deeper explanation.
If we review debates about Japan since 1988 we recognize the international pressures felt by Japan’s politicians and policymakers.
Many nuclear-power plants are located along coastlines, because they are highly water-intensive.
For example, many nuclear-power plants located along the British coast are just a few meters above sea level.
Light-water reactors (LWRs) like those at Fukushima, which use water as a primary coolant, produce most of the world’s nuclear power.
Spain’s reactor at Santa María de Garoña was shut for a week in July 2006 after high temperatures were recorded in the Ebro River.
France likes to showcase its nuclear power industry, which supplies 78% of the country’s electricity.
Nuclear plants located by the sea do not face similar problems in hot conditions, because ocean waters do not heat up anywhere near as rapidly as rivers or lakes.
Today, however, they serve as a useful reminder about the danger of linear projections based on rapidly rising power resources.
Devastated by the war, it did not regain that level until 1964.
Japan also became the world’s largest creditor and largest donor of foreign aid.
Its technology was roughly equal to that of the US – and even slightly ahead in some manufacturing branches.
Alternatively, if Japan were to ally with China, the two countries’ combined resources would make for a potent coalition.
But an alliance also seems unlikely.
Japan\u0027s Political Black Hole
If Kan didn’t know, how could anyone else?
This perception is not entirely false. An important aspect of culture is the use of language.
But some utterances may get lost in translation.
But it might also lead to necessary changes.
During the war, the emperor was omnipotent in theory, but relatively powerless in fact.
TOKYO – The tsunami raced through the town at eight meters per second, the speed of a gold-medal sprinter.
The wave’s height reached 15 meters, towering above even the highest pole-vault bars.
Ships were heaved onto hills, and cars floated like boats.
It looked like the aftermath of the firebombing of Tokyo, or like Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the atomic bombs fell.
Similar scenes can be found throughout the Tōhoku region, along Japan’s northeastern Sanriku Coast.
For example, in the quiet rural city of Rikuzentakata, with a population of 23,000, it is believed that 5,000 of its 8,000 households disappeared in the disaster.
The only buildings that remain standing are the town hall and one supermarket.
Sendai airport, near the coast in Miyagi Prefecture, now looks more like a seaport.
Tsunami is originally a Japanese word.
In order to warn his fellow villagers, who are busy with festival preparations, Gohē uses a torch to set fire to his recently cut sheaves of rice.
This story has influenced Japan ever since.
Indeed, when Japan provided relief to the countries hit by the Sumatra earthquake in 2004, which claimed 250,000 lives, it was keenest to promote an early warning system for tsunamis.
The key word for recovery in Japanese is kizuna (bonds).
When implementing forced blackouts in the region, for example, there were few major traffic accidents, even though traffic lights had stopped working.
Japan’s banks followed suit.
This, as much as anything, helped to bring Japan’s long-running post-WWII economic “miracle” to its knees.
Perhaps they should bear in mind Ernest Hemingway’s description of how a man goes broke: “slowly, then all at once.”
Searches for the missing – mainly at sea – are still continuing.
Even so, disposal of the waste took approximately three years, at a cost to the central government of ¥324.8 billion.
Owing to the tsunami, some of the refuse will ride the waves of the Pacific, reaching Hawaii and the West coast of the United States in a year or so.
But the unseen enemy has aroused concerns – particularly among mothers of young children – that are more a matter of psychology than of science.
Measures to prevent flooding and steps to repair damaged areas of Bangkok cannot even begin until the rubble is cleared.
Haiti and New Zealand have also encountered similar problems.
One might call this “rubble economics.”
Japan was long famous for having the highest saving rate among the industrial countries.
Although the saving rate came down gradually in the 1980’s, it was still 10% in 1990.
Japan is still the third-largest economy in the world after the United States and China.
So what gives?
Remarkably, Japanese savers soak up some 95% of their government’s debt.
Japan is no exception.
But it would be a pity if China’s leaders did not endorse this acknowledgement of Japanese guilt as a manifestation of Japan’s willingness to repent.
Japan Spins Its Wheels
The constitution?
The voters?
The public blames the LDP’s inability to control the bureaucracy, if not its complicity with it.
Japanese Lessons for China’s Currency
But the answers have been all over the map, with some finding that the yuan is not undervalued at all, while others argue that it should appreciate against the dollar by more than 30%.
Clearly, there must be major differences in the macroeconomic models used to produce such a wide range of estimates.
The theoretical problem is simple: a country’s trade balance depends on a lot more than the value of its currency in the foreign exchange markets.
Interest rates, employment, aggregate demand, and technological and institutional innovation all play a role.
During that period, the yen’s value more than doubled against the dollar, rising from its original fixed rate of 360 to 144 at the end of 1989.
At the time of the December 1971 Smithsonian Agreement, 308 yen to the dollar was supposed to do the trick.
At the end of the 1980’s, some analysts thought rates as high as 120 might finally produce the long-sought equilibrium.
Yet, as Japan entered the “lost decade” of the 1990’s, its exports continued to grow faster than its imports.
Japan’s trade surplus peaked only in 1994, at $144 billion, just a few months before the yen’s April 1995 all-time high of 79.75.
The structure of the entire economy matters, too.
TOKYO – Once again, Japan is Asia’s odd country out.
Elsewhere in Asia, including in China, the debate is only beginning.
Abenomics, it seems, is for everyone.
Without a doubt, Israel will be a major obstacle to reaching an agreement.
But Israel is not alone.
Too many people have already died in what has become the worst war of this century.
They are right to point out that its quality – in terms of preservation of the environment, work conditions, or income distribution – matters, too.
Designing and implementing such a package is far from impossible – several elements are already available.
Jedwabne: A New Name of the Holocaust
As with malaria, the TB bacteria had developed resistance to the traditional therapeutic drugs.
A frightening new epidemic of multi-drug-resistant TB – or MDR-TB, which was much harder to treat than mainstream TB – had erupted.
Former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, the remarkable director-general of the WHO at the time, strongly supported this recommendation.
(They are also blind to professional methods in other areas, such as food production.)
Jeremy Lin and the Political Economy of Superstars
I confess to being a huge Lin fan.
Indeed, Lin’s salary, at $800,000, is the NBA’s “minimum wage” for a second-season player.
As a basketball fan, I would not describe the sport as a zero-sum game, even though one team wins and one team loses.
The best players have huge creative flair.
(Artest has now changed his name to Metta World Peace, perhaps in response.)
Jihad or Murder?
Theological disputation has moved far from Islam’s religious academies.
A quick survey of the history of religious conflict shows that theological controversies have never been resolved by theological arguments.
In earlier times, such controversies were decided by political authorities, which used military force to impose one particular point of view at the expense of all others.
These values are the foundation upon which all religious and cultural traditions rest.
But adopting the terrorists’ interpretation of events conceals the reality of this conflict.
Jinnah’s Labyrinth
Moreover, in the Pakistani province of Waziristan, three Sikhs, a minority in Pakistan, were abducted.
When the ransom could not be raised, one was beheaded.
Indeed, by becoming an Islamic state, Pakistan ultimately – and perhaps inevitably –became something of a “jihadi” state.
Of course, there are ideas of Pakistan other than that of an “Islamic state.”
From 1960 until 1991, US recoveries were typically rapid.
But, with few jobs being created, a positive incentive has turned into a source of great anxiety.
Even those who have jobs fear that they could lose them and be cast adrift.
Brazil’s unemployment rate, for example, is at lows not seen for decades.
Jobs and Structure in the Global Economy
Public-sector co-investment properly targeted, however, could shift these incentives by lowering the cost of private technology investment.
John McCain and the Decline of America
Since 1981, the US has been lucky in that inflows of capital from abroad financed the growth of government debt.
A million?
What has posterity ever done for me?” Or was that Groucho Marx?
John Paul the Modernizer
The death of Pope John Paul II was not unexpected, and his immense influence on the modern world will be judged and commented on by everybody who thinks that he has something to say.
Being truthful and faithful to what is the bedrock of Church teaching cannot be deemed conservative.
Only with the Second Vatican Council did things begin to change in the Church, and the impact of John Paul II was immense.
John Paul II was no follower of neo-liberalism.
Indeed, we often forget that both Adam Smith and Herbert Spencer’s reasoning are very similar.
For them, as for John Paul II, the free market and profits were ways to improve humanity.
John Paul II might have been naive, too, but only up to a point.
By this one encyclical, John Paul II moved Church teaching from the Middle Ages to modernity.
We will continue to ask them without his leadership and prompting?
John Stewart Mill vs. the European Central Bank
Physicists start with the four fundamental forces of nature.
The “right” conclusions depend on which of two types of economist you are.
We call this "monetary policy."
In these circumstances, we can be sure of what Mill would have recommended.
More recent scientific gurus, such as Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking, have presented a similar image to the public.
Applied science takes the knowledge provided by pure science and puts it to work.
The instrumental achievements of science would depend solely on the scraps falling from the pure scientist’s table.
But we don’t believe Bacon, either.
If we could acknowledge that, we wouldn’t be joking about it.
But economic closeness is merely the tip of the Iraqi-Jordanian relationship.
More than 80% of Jordanians oppose the war.
These intemperate reactions may seem bizarre.
He is not alone in this belief.
The cause of radical reform has also been taken up by the European Parliament.
And democracy must be reinforced by two chambers of parliament.
Jose Bove Against the Poor
This story is almost completely wrong.
Many examples exist of countries that lifted themselves out of poverty, from South Korea to Costa Rica to Botswana.
The figure is all the more unfathomable, given that, alongside this massive wastage and loss, 840 million people experience chronic hunger on a daily basis.
South Africa Breaks Out
For its part, Brazil has never had one at all.
There is no reason that foreign-owned property should be better protected than property owned by a country’s own citizens.
(Americans, for example, can buy insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.)
The European Union is just emerging from a double-dip (and in some countries a triple-dip) recession, and some member states are in depression.
Most Americans’ income and wealth are below their levels long before the crisis.
The announcement that Tokyo will host the 2020 Olympic Games has also boosted public confidence.
Abe’s supporters reply that the third “arrow” of “Abenomics” – productivity-enhancing structural reforms – has only now been removed from its quiver.
Unlike Europe, where Germany overcame World War II’s legacy through its integration into the European Union, Northeast Asia remains burdened by history.
It does not help that some Korean and Chinese leaders have used anti-Japanese rhetoric to win domestic support.
China challenges Japanese control over more than seven square kilometers of islets – called the Senkaku Islands in Japan, and the Diaoyu Islands in China – in the East China Sea.
The May 1972 transfer back to Japan of Okinawa, which the United States had administered, included the Senkaku Islands.
So, though Japan has administrative control, Chinese ships and planes frequently enter Japanese waters to assert China’s claim.
The British are not alone.
The commissions may even sentence detainees to death, with no appeal to a civilian court whatsoever.
The plaintiffs have raised several objections to the ESM.
Indeed, the new currency was conceived as a unit of account for economic exchange that would not have any wealth implications at all.
In particular, the Target2 credit drawn by the crisis-afflicted countries’ central banks, which already totals almost €1 trillion, should also be taken into consideration.
The European Union can be based only on the rule of law.
Other war crimes courts have taken place in the immediate aftermath of conflict.
This must be reinforced by vigorous independent monitoring throughout the process.
Third, the court site is located in a military compound far from downtown Phnom Penh.
The proceedings should be broadcast nationwide on radio and television.
Fifth, Cambodia has a shortage of highly qualified lawyers, because the legal profession was nearly wiped out by the Khmer Rouge.
Jumping Viruses
All types of virus strains or variants exist - somewhat akin to dogs existing as different breeds.
Less well known is the fact that cats and dogs are infected by a coronavirus that can also cause disease in pigs.
There is simply no room for complacency where viruses - or bacteria, for that matter - are concerned.
As we come close to other animals, their viruses come closer to us.
But if an influenza virus jumps from, say, ducks to chickens, there may be lethal consequences.
Most probably, the viruses came from the wild animals in whose environment we were encroaching.
It is also possible that - again by chance - a benign SARS virus from a civet cat mutatedafter it infected people, becoming highly virulent.
Jurassic Park for Sale
Unless action is taken, fossils will continue to be sold to the highest bidder.
One day they found an ancient reptile with long ribs that enabled it to glide between trees.
He asked the Museum for compensation for the fossil.
So the Museum let Icarosaurus go.
The fossil was offered to the highest bidder.
Why does it not belong to everyone?
Fossil bones are harvested and made into mounted skeletons, often with little regard for accuracy.
But Jurrasic Park is fiction, dinosaurs will be no more.
The US is not alone in this problem.
China, Argentina, Brazil, and many other countries are losing their fossil resources to marketplaces, fossil conventions, and internet dealers.
International cooperation is one way to stem this tide; stronger internal laws another.
Practices vary among countries and even within them.
On the other hand, commercial collectors could work with scientists and the public.
Take global warming.
So no change in policy.
Even before the invasion, there was overwhelming evidence that Bush was lying.
It is also possible that he did not believe what he read.
America has not won the hearts and minds of those in Iraq; indeed, it has lost them, just as it has lost the hearts and minds of much of the world.
Nonsense.
In that case, Europe was as much the culprit as America.
Justice Comes to Chad
No one yet thinks that Chad is that country.
Justice for Some
In America in the wake of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, it has done neither.
They should not be allowed to do so.
In America, the venality is at a higher level.
It is not particular judges that are bought, but the laws themselves, through campaign contributions and lobbying, in what has come to be called “corruption, American-style.”
Bankruptcy laws were amended to introduce a system of “partial indentured servitude.”
But it is also important to keep families and communities intact.
Justice for Srebrenica’s Dead
Of course, the Bosnian Serb commander, Ratko Mladić remains a fugitive.
A Serb district president, Miroslav Deronjić, testified that Karadžić told him: “Miroslav, those people there must be killed.”
Karadžić would still be flogging love potions in Belgrade.
The retired generals would be tanning beside the Adriatic.
Doctors Without Borders introduced the concept of "the right of intervention" in humanitarian disasters, bypassing the strictures of traditional international law.
But today it is the Westphalian order that is in decline, along with the significance of state borders.
As someone who served in Merkel’s government from 2009 to 2011, I must admit that I was rather careless in the use of mobile communication devices while in office.
In principle, of course, one should always assume that foreign intelligence services attempt to listen in on other governments’ conversations.
Today it does not.
The American Revolution can be traced directly to the growing sense among colonists that Parliament's rule in North America was illegitimate.
Britain failed in America and the French crown failed in France because the governed ceased to recognize their authority.
Many Uzbeks, Turkmens, and even some Tajiks, feel excluded.
Every politically active person in the country understands the reality of this power grab.
They are frustrated at the international community's blindness to their fate.
Reason and the End of Poverty
But this is mere suggestion.
Keep the IMF Out of Europe
There are at least three reasons why the IMF should resist this pressure, and abstain from increasing its (already extremely high) exposure to Europe.
Northern Europe’s Drag on the World Economy
And there would be a rush into jewelry and other hard-to-detect real assets.
Kentucky Fried University?
With the establishment of each new on-line degree program and science park, universities appear more vulnerable to this mindset.
Even in the heyday of the welfare state, service provision was precisely what lay behind academia's appeal to policymakers.
Universities, along with churches, religious orders, guilds, and cities, were the original corporations.
Commercial ventures came to be regularly treated as corporations only in the 19 th century. 
In the former phase, academia generates new forms of social advantage and privilege, while in the latter phase, it eliminates them.
Kerry and Europe
Those whom the gods would destroy, they grant their wishes.
Those in Europe and around the world who yearn for a victory by John Kerry in the US presidential election ought to keep that bit of ancient Greek wisdom in mind.
But they are not going to change their policy to help Kerry win, and they won't change even if he does.
According to Michel Barnier, France's Foreign Minister, "Neither today, nor tomorrow," will French troops be sent.
So some compromise must be found should Kerry win.
The key point here is joint recognition that a fundamental transatlantic community of values exists, and that both sides need each other.
Kerry vs. Bush: Will Reason Prevail?
These have long been dominant questions in America's strategic debate.
And the norms and rules that govern international institutions constitute a boundary on American power - and thus as a check on its hegemony.
STOCKHOLM – Take a deep breath.
Savor it for a moment.
Carbon-dioxide levels are higher today than they have been in at least 800,000 years.
The amount of nitrogen and sulfur circulating through the Earth system has doubled.
The ocean’s pH is changing at an unprecedented rate, reaching levels of acidity that marine organisms have not experienced in the last 20 million years.
Of course, addressing interconnected issues simultaneously carries its share of challenges.
Keynes and Social Democracy Today
On one hand, capitalism offers the best safeguard of individual freedom, choice, and entrepreneurial initiative.
Until The General Theory was published in 1936, social democrats did not know how to go about achieving full employment.
Their policies were directed at depriving capitalists of the ownership of the means of production.
The public was never to substitute for the private, but merely to complement it.
Being too big to fail simply means being too big.
That rings truer today – more than 70 years later – than in his own day.
State intervention needs to bridge gaps that the private sector cannot reasonably be expected to do on its own.
Keynes versus the Classics: Round Two
Far from having too much math, economists need more, in order to “keep the logic straight.”
On the stimulus, though, Krugman achieves a knock-out punch.
And what Gazprom is to natural gas, Rosneft (almost) is to oil.
He is a graduate of the FSB academy and is the son of the former FSB director, Nikolai Patrushev.
The list goes on and on.
Capitalism seemed to be dying.
The Twentieth Congress put an end to that.
It was a moment of truth, a cleansing from within of the brutality of Stalinism.
I did everything that others did.
The whole Stalinist system of government was built on absolute secrecy, in which only the General Secretary himself knew the whole story.
Khrushchev, for example, was stunned when he discovered that in the 1930’s and 1940’s, some 70% of Party members were annihilated.
Initially, Khrushchev didn’t plan to keep his denunciation of Stalin a secret.
An uprising in Poland and the far more tumultuous Hungarian Revolution argued for the opposite.
Worried by the protests, Khrushchev tried to cool off the anti-Stalin campaign.
These were publicly reported and discussed on TV and radio.
Stalingrad became Volgograd.
In response, central banks should purchase government bonds for cash in as large a quantity as needed to push their prices up as high as possible.
Those are attractive odds.
This sharing of information will reduce risk – somewhat.
Doing more would require a legislative coalition that is not there yet.
Kicking the Oil Habit
As a technologically advanced and major automobile-producing country, Germany is well placed to bring about such an initiative.
Kidney for Sale
According to the International Society of Nephrology, kidney disease affects more than 500 million people worldwide, or 10% of the adult population.
With more people developing high blood pressure and diabetes (key risks for kidney disease), the picture will only worsen.
Similarly, patients from Qatar who traveled to Manila are “looking for alternative solutions,” according to The Peninsula .
The truth is that trafficking will stop only when the need for organs disappears.
Momentum is growing.
It is likely that consumption of no other fish has soared more than that of farmed salmon, with production surging by almost 300% in 20 years.
Although each krill may only grow to weigh about two grams, together they constitute one of the most abundant animal species on Earth.
The Southern Ocean contains the largest population of krill in the world.
The increased demand for krill, together with the new catching and processing capabilities, has combined in a way that the Antarctic ecosystem might not be able to withstand.
A time-out is essential.
We don’t care how it goes, just put an end to it.”
Killing Justice in Russia
In fact, in 2009, Medvedev’s second year in office, a devastating series of such killings occurred.
Markelov, a lawyer, routinely tackled the human rights cases that no one else was willing to take on.
All of their work was ended by assassins.
Killing the Cures
One way that is often overlooked is the damaging impact on medical science.
Consider the polar bear, threatened with extinction in the wild by climate change.
These mammals spend up to seven months of the year hibernating, during which time they are essentially immobile.
But hibernating bears are just the beginning of the story.
This has not happened.
Killing the Death Penalty
It is finally happening.
But had we followed that route, we would most likely have failed.
That lesson is that Europe has more friends than it has enemies in the world.
These friends deserve respect and attention.
Not only does it work, but, above all, in some cases, it is the only way of moving forward.
Yet, since that time, greenhouse-gas emissions have continued to soar.
That will certainly be true of domestic climate-change legislation.
The administrative route might turn out to be even more important than the legislative route. 
It is time for the US to rejoin the global family.
Burning hydrocarbons (natural gas and petrol) yields both water and CO2.
In Europe, indigenous coal production no longer plays an important economic role.
The meetings are aimed at creating the impression that the world’s leaders are still working on a solution to the problem.
The man who will be president has not yet displayed any of the attributes of a caudillo.
But both the passage of time and his political maturation as the governor of Patagonia have converted him into a European-style Social Democrat.
Some 50 insurgents died recently in an assault on Lashkar gar, the capital of Helmand province.
Two days after making that gloomy assessment, the French chief of the defense staff, General Jean-Louis Georgelin, followed suit.
They believe that boosting allied forces will only increase the sense of occupation and give the Taliban more targets.
To retreat from its first major “out of area” mission would be a damaging blow for the alliance.
And what about the British?
The British were burned there twice (1840-1, 1878-80). So were the Russians.
No formulae the text-books know,
Will turn the bullet from your coat,
Or ward the tulwar’s downward blow
Strike hard who cares – shoot straight who can –
The odds are on the cheaper man.
That is an exaggeration.
Will a democratically elected president in Belgrade mean that everything has changed for Serbia, but that nothing has changed in Serbia’s relations with Kosovo?
It should begin in Serbia and Montenegro as well.
Kosovo is Europe’s Responsibility
This document maintains the fiction that Kosovo is subject to the "sovereignty" of the "Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
It has every form of political organization: NGOs, an international governing authority, political parties of every stripe.
Their specialties are drugs, smuggling, and, recently, traffic in women.
Corruption may become what it has nearly become in Russia: not the exception to the rule but the rule itself.
This October local elections will be held.
Can the Kosovars write a constitution on their own?
The degree of devotion to democracy among local parties is unknown.
The UN accommodated these self-appointed authorities.
There are other paths.
In part, it will depend on other states around us, who can recognize us.
In the last analysis, self-government cannot be derived from international documents; it is in the people.
PRISTINA – Hundreds of people disappeared ten years ago in Kosovo, the former Serbian province that is now the world’s newest state.
Most were Serb civilians. Relatives of most report that they were abducted.
Kosovo, to a significant degree, owes its independence to a NATO military intervention undertaken in the name of human rights.
Villages were burned.
The UN sent a mission to help establish local institutions.
Now the BBC has broadcast interviews with Albanians who were imprisoned in secret UCK camps in Albania.
(Likewise, no one should forget the Albanian dead that Serbia has not returned.)
On the record, leaders of this mission say that they are interested in investigating.
Kremlin Musical Chairs
He disliked his predecessor, Mikhail Gorbachev, as much his predecessors disliked their predecessors.
Kuwaiti Democracy in Action
Kuwait has just held its eleventh parliamentary election since independence in 1961.
With independence in 1961, these rules were codified in a constitution.
Nevertheless, since the liberation of Kuwait following the Iraqi occupation in August 1990, the parliament has gained both stability and respect.
Political violence has been rare.
With this election, Kuwaiti women participated in choosing the parliament for the first time.
The electorate focused almost entirely on the question of electoral districts.
They were wrong to do so.
We need to ask ourselves if this should be our first priority.
Moreover, they put urgent responses to climate change at the bottom of the list.
For example:
· At a recent meeting at Exeter in the UK, some participants warned of a 50-50 chance that the Gulf Stream winds could collapse within a century.
Hence a shutdown during the twenty-first century is regarded as unlikely.”
· We are told that sea levels will rise – by roughly 50 centimeters by 2100 in some scenarios.
This is correct, and it will clearly cause problems in low-lying countries like Bangladesh.
But the alarmists neglect to mention that sea levels rose through the twentieth century by 10-25 centimeters.
It makes us believe that we only have one choice.
Far from it.
Which is better?
La Nausée Russe
Georgia was the first to oust its communist apparatchiks.
So we have to keep running like a squirrel in a cage.
For how long?
For as long as there is strength…”
Russia must rid itself, once and for all, of Putinism’s systemic corruption, lest the country be consumed by it.
Labor’s Paradise Lost
In fact, working hours have not fallen since the early 1980’s.
Since the 1980’s, we have never regained the full employment levels of the 1950’s and 1960’s.
But there is something else.
Modern capitalism inflames through every sense and pore the hunger for consumption.
Lady Macbeth of Pyongyang
So, just as a Confucian son’s absolute duty is to revere his father, the absolute duty of a Confucian subject is to revere the ruler.
She became a member of the all-powerful Central Committee in 1988 – a post she retains to this day.
Watching from afar, the doctor saw Kim Il-sung holding a pistol.
He believes that he was summoned to treat bleeding caused by something else.
The IMF, like many organizations where workers spend long trips together, has its share of intra-office romances.
But the environment is professional, and not hostile to women.
The US is fighting the wrong war.
On the ground, it has little political and economic relevance, and it would be militarily impracticable to re-impose the line.
The agreements have widespread support in Congress.
Latin America After Bush
Again, Bush left him hanging.
Alvaro Uribe of Colombia was happy just to have a US Chief of State visit Bogotá; the last one to do so was Ronald Reagan in 1982.
Several crucial decisions lay ahead.
Latin America and the New Financial Architecture
The FSF was set up by the G-7 in early 1999.
Drawing a parallel from this national evolution, developing a financial architecture to perform similar functions in the international arena is essential.
Such architecture requires:
The issues discussed profoundly affect their economies.
Some countries – Mexico, Colombia, and Peru – appear to want a privileged direct relationship with America.
Uribe won an unprecedented re-election two years ago with an absolute majority in the first round of the vote.
Earlier this year, Mexico’s foreign minister renegotiated $400 million of debt on which Cuba had defaulted.
Both Brazil and Mexico see business opportunities on the island, especially since Raúl Castro has already made Cuba more open to foreign investment.
Rather, it symbolizes and highlights underlying weaknesses in the operation of the state and its interactions with citizens and businesses.
A second lesson is the importance of flexibility.
But flexibility is not a synonym for “pure” floating.
There are too many walls erected against social mobility, competition, and fairness in politics and business.
The region is both more democratic and more unequal than it was ten years ago.
State monopolies are sold to friends who then become multibillionaires, like Mexico’s Carlos Slim.
This has sustained a model that places more value on the extraction of resources than on the education and empowerment of people.
But this optimism is misplaced.
For example, tests administered by the OECD in 2003 found that Brazilian students ranked last in mathematics among 40 countries.
According to a 2004 survey by The Times of London, not a single Latin American university is ranked among the top 200 in the world.
In addition, paying teachers according to performance must become the norm, while ineffective teachers should be dismissed.
Latin America’s Era of Milk and Honey
Driven mainly by the almost insatiable appetites of China and India, a profound burst of growth has come to Latin America.
On the one hand, world trade is growing, and so are Latin America’s exports. On the other hand, the terms of trade have improved.
Another phenomenon is linked to the first.
Today, what might be considered electoral democracies are found throughout the region.
Indeed, at no time since independence has there been such a proliferation of democracy in Latin America.
This isn’t for lack of structural reforms.
During 1977, the worst year for human rights violations, the average Latin American rate of terror stood at 3.0.
Today, Latin American states need political agreements that protect them from becoming the victims of both North American unilateralism and the global economy.
A couple of months later, The Economist endorsed that idea, which has since been repeated by countless apologists and experts.
The mood about Latin America was equally optimistic at the start of the 1980’s.
Bank loans from the US were plentiful, and countries like Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay were growing fast.
The early and mid-1990’s witnessed another wave of optimism.
Brazil blew up in 1998, and Argentina melted down in 2001.
Indeed, today there are two Latin Americas: natural resource-rich South America and natural resource-poor Central America and Mexico.
Not surprisingly, South America is growing much faster than its neighbors to the North – 4.4 versus 2.7% in 2010-11, according to a recent Inter-American Development Bank report.
The report estimates that Argentina’s economy will expand by 6.1% in that period, while Costa Rica’s will grow by 3.8% and El Salvador’s by just 1.6%.
By the end of 2016, Brazil will have hosted both the World Cup and the Olympic Games.
But its economic competitiveness is another story.
Today, fiscal policy remains too expansionary in virtually every Latin American country.
Four factors have put it on this path.
But with growth in China's coastal region running at possibly 15% per year, who can seriously doubt that in 15 years it will surpass Brazil?
Latin America did well when soft money flowed in, but those times are largely over.
Latin America\u0027s Never-Ending Story
Here we go again.
Take Brazil.
Brazil has been more successful than Argentina in raising tax revenues.
Latin America does not need financial engineering.
Sadly, we will be able to use it again, with no change, at the next round of Latin American crises.
Ours is a region of cruel contrasts.
Fortunately, many countries in this part of the world have recognized that regional welfare must be addressed as a regional challenge.
I am proud to list Costa Rica among them.
Our nation may be small, but our commitment to improving the well-being of this region is anything but.
Costa Rica is the region’s most stable democracy, a place where peace, nature, and education are valued above all.
This is the spirit of the upcoming conference.
But not this time ­– at least so far.
Only one Latin American country (Haiti) appears in the group of low HDI countries, while the rest are in the medium and high HDI groups.
The Consulta de San José in Costa Rica asked a group of leading economic experts to rank solutions to the biggest challenges facing the region.
Mothers and older siblings become free to work or to further their own education.
Most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean spend less than 2% of GDP on infrastructure, compared with 3% to 6% in China and Korea.
Chilean markets also have stayed relatively calm.
Only 2% are between 61 and 90 days late.
Latin America’s Two Lefts
For them, rhetoric is more important than substance and power is more important than how it is exercised.
Law and Order, Russian-Style
Only then will I be able to express an opinion.
This will be all but impossible without cooperation with non-governmental human rights organizations in Russia.
Indeed, I view one of my tasks as being to facilitate contacts between these groups and the authorities.
Le défi Chinois6e3bd40146f86f4031f85308
The new China is symbolized by an electronics components factory in Shenzhen in the Pearl River (Zhu Jiang) Delta.
All were young women.
They can find another job--that's not my problem."
But the real key to China's success is not found in Beijing, but at lower levels of government.
The same is happening with electronics and machinery.
What does this Chinese juggernaut mean for Japan, Europe, the US, and other wealthy regions?
For consumers, it is an unalloyed boon.
When we meet the enemy, we will discover that it is us.
Leaderless Global Governance
Economic policies come in roughly four variants.
Greenhouse-gas emissions are the archetypal case.
Leaders and Managers
Senators manage a roughly 100-member staff, and a campaign staff of several hundreds.
They must avoid the “emperor’s trap” of hearing only about the beauty of their new clothes.
Experts argue that well designed systems are like stage directions in a play.
They encourage actors to make correct entrances and exits without being told.
People always try to bend systems to their own purposes, and good leaders play a critical role in maintaining their systems’ integrity.
Learning Economic Dynamism
But this isn't what ails their economies now .
So, what is the problem?
Of these, Hans-Werner Sinn's Ist Deutschland noch zu retten? (Can Germany Still Be Saved?) stands out for its cogent argument.
Learning from America
But the American national drama is the drama of immigration: everyone, except Native Americans, came from somewhere else.
How different it is in Western Europe.
Turkish Gastarbeiter are still, two generations later, not seen as fully German.
As long as there is a Church of England, if you are Jewish or Muslim or Sikh, there is a subtle level at which you will simply not feel fully English.
Only then would we see a British, French, Dutch, or German Obama.
Collectively, we have done well on the former, and very poorly on the latter.
The modern equivalent of that learning about trade policy would be to think about mechanisms to ensure long-term improvement in fiscal policymaking.
Learning from Lebanon
The two countries have so much in common.
In Lebanon, sectarian power-sharing is enshrined in the constitution.
Each major faction is represented in government.
Then there are the Sunni Arabs.
Learning from Mexico
Similar electoral conflicts unfolded in the United States in 2000 and in Ukraine in 2004.
Unlike Yushchenko, he was denied.
This suggests that governing principles and sturdy political institutions, not powerful individuals, have become the bedrock of Mexican governance.
Learning from the Cold War
All of these factors played a part.
Such an approach served the world well during the Cold War; it could do the same now.
Indeed, London’s Arsenal football club is composed entirely of foreigners, including a French coach.
Football thus provides a glimpse of how true globalization of labor would work.
No limits were ever imposed on players’ movements, except by Communist countries.
Consider the number of clubs that have qualified for the European Champions’ League top eight slots.
The bottom line is simple: fewer and fewer clubs are making it into the European elite.
Since the English Premier League was started in 1992, only one championship was not won by Manchester United, Arsenal, or Chelsea.
In Italy, all but two Serie A championships since 1991 have been won by either Juventus or AC Milan.
In Spain, all but three championships since 1985 have been won by either Real Madrid or Barcelona.
When the best players play together, the quality of each, and of the team as a whole, increases exponentially.
The same is true of all games played at the final tournament, not only those among the top eight national teams.
A good Danish or Bulgarian player improves much faster if he joins Manchester United or Barcelona.
Second, that improvement in quality was “captured” by national teams thanks to FIFA’s rule requiring players to play only for their national team.
The same rule could be applied to other activities.
Learning the Lessons of Iraq
That political settlement has not occurred.
The Iraq war has been financed entirely on credit; and partly because of that, the US national debt has increased by two-thirds in just eight years.
America’s European allies are tiring of the endless battles and mounting casualties.
Learning to Lead
In my book The Powers to Lead , I call this skill “contextual intelligence.”
Music and painting are based in part on innate skills, but also on training and practice.
Learning leadership occurs in a variety of ways.
Learning from experience is the most common and most powerful.
Most people “lead from the middle.”
To make this formula work, however, requires a good deal of soft power.
Education is also important in the Arab context because of its special status in Islam, which, like Judaism and Christianity, is a religion of the book.
The Arab golden ages, in eleventh-century Baghdad and fourteenth-century Andalucía, are revered as periods of great learning.
After these golden ages, education fell into decline.
But they did not have the resources to keep up with their own growing populations.
The cost of two cruise missiles would build a school, the cost of a Eurofighter a small university.
Leaving Baghdad
No longer.
In the end, it will prove to be a false and misguided calculation.
The US invasion was a grave mistake.
Lebanon Goes West
BEIRUT – Lebanon’s voters have handed a clear defeat to the Hezbollah-led March 8 alliance.
Neither Hezbollah nor Amal wanted this.
Lebanon’s Example to Iraq
Iraq’s voters have spoken.
Now a new government must be formed and a new constitution written.
This would reinforce the need for inter-communal cooperation and minimize the risk of a return to any form of communal domination or dictatorship.
Lebanon’s Moment of Decision
Lebanon is at a historic crossroad.
If not, phases three and four will be completed by other means.
All these issues have now become part of the national debate.
Most importantly, the government mistakenly reckoned that Hezbollah would not risk Shia-Sunni clashes in Beirut.
Lebanon’s Time of Trial
Indeed, the influence of outside powers remains a central part of the equation.
But this did not prevent a decrease in Turkish-Lebanese trade last year.
Yet this did not deter Turkey from organizing the Third Turkish-Arab Forum on July 10, 2010, with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon.
Hariri’s government is set to keep its 71-member majority in Lebanon’s 128-seat parliament, helped by the 8% economic growth projected for this year.
For smaller economies, however, internationalization will be far more difficult.
But creating such a system would take time.
Spain, however, is a democracy.
Ophuls’s film was not shown on French state television until 1981.
After Franco’s death in 1975, Spain, too, treated its recent history with remarkable discretion.
Children of Franco’s victims are making up for their parents’ silence.
Suddenly, the Civil War is everywhere, in books, television shows, movies, academic seminars, and now in the legislature, too.
This is not only a European phenomenon.
Or does it?
His opponent received 44%.
The defeated candidate, Viktor Yanukovich, contests the result.
It is also complicated.
Will the planned elections in Iraq be regarded as legitimate internally as well as externally?
What is legal, they think, is also legitimate.
The second question is whether there remains any systematic, potentially violent opposition to the outcome.
Not in Britain, nor among Britain’s partners.
Why do they underwrite risks that drive their banks to the brink of bankruptcy?
The bad accounting system is the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which is now used by big companies throughout the world.
Indeed, it was a major reason for the German financial system’s stability.
But that period is over.
Today’s unemployment, after all, is structural, rather than the result of perverse incentives.
The new transition process must emphasize consensus, with “no victor, no vanquished” serving as a guiding principle.
The recent events threaten this historic transformation.
The street has now become much more strategic.
Lessons from a Divided Island
CAMBRIDGE: Seven hundred miles off Florida’s coast lies one of the most impoverished places on earth.
Hispaniola was Christopher Columbus’s first stop in the New World.
But reality is more cruel.
Hispaniola is home to two nations.
Haiti, on the western side, is the poorest country in the Americas.
The Dominican Republic, to the east, is more successful, with six times Haiti’s average income.
Tropical forests were cut down to expand the plantations.
The result was a huge budget deficit by the middle of the 1980's.
Tax cuts made Reagan enormously popular and helped win him re-election in 1984.
They hope to dismantle programs such as Social Security and Medicare.
The US can serve as an early warning to other countries.
The White House ought to provide others with the same caveat that magicians on television give their viewers: "Do not try this at home."
DAVOS – The World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos has lost some of its pre-crisis panache.
Those days are gone.
But a remark by one mining company executive from a developing country caught the spirit of change.
Overall, the private sector in Europe and America has been unable to create many good jobs since the beginning of the current century.
The Detroit Syndrome
SINGAPORE – When the city of Detroit filed for bankruptcy last week, it became the largest such filing in United States history.
Detroit’s population has dropped from 1.8 million in 1950, when it was America’s fifth-largest city, to less than 700,000 today.
Its industrial base lies shattered.
Instead, cities like New York and London have experienced sharp increases in population since 1990, after decades of decline.
As it transformed itself into the “factory of the world,” the share of China’s urban population jumped from 26.4% in 1990 to around 53% today.
This process of urban growth, however, is about to unravel.
During the Great Depression, the great American economist Irving Fisher focused on the adverse effects of falling prices.
How can Japan's deflation be reversed?
Even the richest country in the world has limited resources.
He recently signed a lavish infrastructure bill that included, among other payoffs to political supporters, an infamous bridge to nowhere in Alaska.
That’s one of the reasons why the military does not use a price system to allocate resources.
Recent evidence is at least consistent with that hypothesis.
Yet there is perhaps a silver lining in the clouds over New Orleans.
Bad policies are, more often than not, easier to sell than good ones. 
In Poland in 2005, the issue was mainly corruption.
The index of the frequency of paying bribes in 2005 was 2.03 in Poland, 2.22 in Slovakia, 2.09 in the Czech Republic, and 2.37 in Greece.
The corruption tax in 2005 was 0.7% in Poland, 0.93% in Slovakia, and 0.63% in Hungary.
Lessons From the North
They have also achieved high standards of governance.
But each of these propositions is refuted by the Nordic experience.
Nor has high taxation in the Nordic countries impeded economic performance.
Moreover, economic growth in the Nordic countries has been similar to that in the US in recent years.
Several factors appear to explain the Nordic countries’ economic success.
But how replicable are the Nordic successes?
Indeed, it is at times like this that the world truly does seem like a global village.
The Bush administration’s face-saving rhetoric that it had rushed to push together the core group in the absence of other efforts was quietly let to pass.
Low lying islands like the Maldives will become submerged.
We are, however, still not a global village.
This has been the fate of some of our standard macroeconomic policies.
This prescription has one problem.
Emails are intercepted.
Zhao Ziyang was General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1989.
If only they could take place in China.
Life in the capital, and many Chinese cities, had been severely disrupted.
South Korean students filling the streets of Seoul in 1986 could not have ended the authoritarian military government either.
They lacked the authority.
They were not politicians.
Yet the cornerstone of Europe’s approach – a continent-wide emissions trading system for the greenhouse gases that cause climate change – is in trouble.
As the world economy grows, so do emissions of these gases, accelerating the pace of human-caused climate change.
The main greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide.
Oil provides the main fuel for transportation worldwide.
Some countries will also continue to use nuclear power.
The second solution is to capture CO2 emissions for storage underground.
Another is to capture it directly from the air using specially designed chemical processes.
The big problem is time.
Even if the US economy shifts from coal to natural gas, America’s coal will probably be exported for use elsewhere in the world.
Time is short.
Lessons of the Lebanon War
Olmert reportedly did not see the need.
INET has been given complete freedom – with respect to both content and strategy – and one hopes that it will draw further support from other sources.
Its only commitment is to “new economic thinking,” in the broadest sense.
The marketplace for ideas also often works in a way that is less than ideal.
All emphasized exports; none grossly violated property rights.
India barely reformed its cumbersome trade and industrial regime before its economy took off in the 1980s.
Institutional arrangements also have large elements of specificity.
Two-track reform worked well in Deng's China but not in Gorbachev's Soviet Union.
Such a process will not succeed.
Let Developing Nations Rule
There are two related reasons for this.
Developing nations also need to enshrine the notion of “policy space” in the World Trade Organization.
Raise it too much, and the economy slides into recession and unemployment.
Even when not formally designated as such, central banks have become the guardians of financial-market sanity.
As a member of the Fed’s Board of Governors under Greenspan during 2002-2005, Bernanke can also be faulted for having played along.
They operated under the assumption that what is good for Wall Street is good for Main Street.
Prices set by financial markets are the right ones for allocating capital and other resources to their most productive uses .
A plethora of anniversaries is arriving in Russia.
This month marks the 90th anniversary of the October Revolution of 1917 and the 25th anniversary of the death of Leonid Brezhnev.
The October Revolution has always had many critics.
The Russian philosopher Ivan Shmelev named it “the great beating of Russia.”
The revolution is not only history for many people; it is also a part of life and consciousness.
The most important archives were inaccessible, and some documents were destroyed.  
Although today’s new political reality in Russia is creating its own new myths and falsifications, this has not extended to historians’ work.
A monument to Admiral Alexander Kolchak, who led the White effort to overthrow the Bolsheviks, has been erected in Irkutsk, and a monument to Nicholas II has been built in Moscow.
Indeed, the Orthodox Church has consecrated Nicholas II a saint.
Since September, this new market has traded the Eurozone’s Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, or HICP – a contract that traders call the “hiccup.”
The open interest recently was 355 contracts, with a notional value of €355 million.
How a concept is framed, the context and associations with which it is presented, affect human judgments enormously.
The money illusion occurs because we are accustomed to economic values almost always being framed in terms of money.
It would be easy and virtually costless.
Indexed units of account are not a new idea; Chile’s government led the way in 1967 by creating the Unidad de Fomento (UF), and other Latin American countries have followed suit.
But what about agriculture?
Should the good times start rolling again so soon?
This basket should include, at the very least, preferred shares and bonds.
Five years later, the results speak for themselves.
Greek-Turkish rapprochement has created the framework for closer relations between Turkey and the EU.
As a progressive party, PASOK has every interest in Turkey’s progress on democratic reforms.
A road map must be drawn up for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus and a settlement of the political division of the island.
Yugoslavia's new leadership should now be allowed to deal with Milosevic in a way that promotes democracy within Yugoslavia.
They will be wrong.
Why this inaction?
Letter from Palestine
Such an impressive sequence of events has not been seen for a long time in that troubled region.
But, for the Palestinians, there can be no negotiations that do not include both issues.
Only the US and Canada voted against.
Under his rule, Libya has supported terrorist organizations worldwide--from the IRA to various Palestinian extremist groups.
A Dutch commission of enquiry later admitted that the UN Dutch battalion was, in fact, complicit in that war crime.
But it will be a mere shadow of what it should, and could, be.
A new society – what we call the Networked Society – is emerging.
Liberia Now, Zimbabwe Next?
Moreover, like his West African counterpart, Mugabe has presided over a decaying economy and a restless population.
Bush expressed satisfaction with the mediating role played by South African President Thabo Mbeki, whose ineffectual ``quiet diplomacy'' has left Zimbabweans both weary and suspicious.
Only then will Africa's tolerance for tyrants be ended.
Liberty and Music
Interviews with some of the musicians revealed an awareness of this.
He wanted to limit musical expression to sounds that were conducive to harmony and order.
This, more or less, has been the line taken by dictatorships as well.
The Dear Leader’s son, Kim Jong-chol, is said to be a fan of Eric Clapton.
Precisely because of this, “forbidden” music was politicized.
Subversive youths in Hitler’s Germany – the “Swing Jugend” – secretly listened to jazz.
The air of Czechoslovakia in 1968 was electric with the imported sounds of the Rolling Stones and Frank Zappa’s Mothers of Invention.
Václav Havel was a fan of Zappa.
Of course, that was the point.
Hlavsa and his long-haired fans, celebrated in Tom Stoppard’s brilliant play, Rock n’Roll , didn’t want the state to spoil their party.
They wanted to dance to their own tunes.
Obviously, Dvorak and Wagner are not Zappa and the Stones.
Performing good music in North Korea just might have a positive effect.
Stalin’s empire needed no foreign classical orchestras.
China no longer needed the Stones, either.
There are plenty of rock bands in China already.
Liberty’s Revolutionary Muse
Friedman’s views made him a guiding light for economic conservatives worldwide.
Libya After Qaddafi
In short, freedom is worth the price.
Violent polarization has developed not only between Eastern and Western tribes, but also between some of the Western tribes.
Last month, for example, armed clashes erupted between rebels in al-Zintan and the villagers of al-Rayyaniya, 15 kilometers away.
Several figures from the “free officers” – the group that plotted the 1969 coup against the monarchy – are leading the INC.
Vladimir Putin’s rule in Russia illustrates this outcome.
Albania, Mongolia, and India successfully passed more complicated tests – and offer some useful lessons in democratic transitions under unfavourable conditions.
In 2007, Libya had 22 sha‘biya (administrative districts), not three.
Libya Calling
It should be above the constitution, and not an article for referendum.”
These organizations are numerous, but small.
Bin Qumu has a small paramilitary force training in the Bou Musafir forest on the outskirts of Derna.
He insists that if the head of the boy scouts or the city’s clan leaders asked him to disband the training camp, he would do so.
Libya’s Lord of the Flies
The statement summarizes the Libyan regime’s extremely repressive response to the popular uprising against Qaddafi’s 42-year dictatorship.
The response of father and son has been to incite violence against foreigners.
But, at least so far, there have been no splits reported among the Revolutionary Committees, Qaddafi’s diehard loyalists, who are estimated to total around 20,000 fighters.
The same is true of Brigade 32, which is headed by another of Qaddafi’s seven sons, Khamis al-Qaddafi.
Yet signs from Libya’s East, now a “Qaddafi-free” zone, indicate otherwise.
The names of those who head the forces responsible for the killings that have occurred are well known.
Third, the LIA saga highlights SWFs’ potential cumulative effect on the stability of global markets.
Bahrain and Dubai come to mind.
Libya’s Transition to Transition
One representative was named to the Council because he defected with his MIG fighter plane 20 years ago.
His last foreign-intelligence chief, Abu Zayd Dorda, epitomizes this trend.
With elections set to be held no later than June 23, the Council has less than four months to prepare Libya for its first free vote in sixty years.
While the battle against Qaddafi was still raging, Libyans considered it unpatriotic to point out the NTC’s weaknesses.
The NTC deliberates rather than decides.
Many NTC members believe that the Council lacks the legitimacy to make tough choices.
The NTC’s first prime minister, Mahmud Jibril, was praised by the international community for his vision.
The ICC prosecutor echoed his sentiments in a June 5 legal brief, noting that “the Government of Libya may be unable to move the case forward.”
Life after Capitalism
LONDON – In 1995, I published a book called The World After Communism.
My discontent is with the quality of a civilization in which the production and consumption of unnecessary goods has become most people’s main occupation.
But socialism, in its classical form, failed – as it had to.
This made him a fervent free trader.
This amounts to saying that even though rich countries (or regions) no longer need the benefits of free trade, they must continue to suffer its costs.
And increasing numbers do, in fact, “drop out.”
It was only in the eighteenth century that greed became morally respectable.
This inspired the American way of life, where money always talks.
Life after Darwin
MARSEILLE – Many Greek philosophers perceived the world to be in perpetual motion – a process of constant evolution.
Indeed, we now know that the proportion of genetic sequences on earth that belongs to visible organisms is negligible.
Viruses contain another 15-30% of these genetic sequences.
The unidentified genetic sequences pose a problem, because it is not known whether vehicles other than viruses, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes exist.
Human cells comprise genes of eukaryotic, bacterial, archaean, and viral origin.
Moreover, certain viruses’ size and genetic repertoire is comparable with that of bacteria, archaea, or small eukaryotes.
Indeed, the life of giant viruses is as complex as that of like-sized microorganisms.
Without ribosomes, traditionalists say, viruses cannot be considered biological entities comparable to other microbes.
But that is pure dogma; these viruses are akin to the other microbes.
This understanding also refutes the legend of “Mitochondrial Eve,” the woman from whom all humans supposedly descend on their mother’s side.
For, if Mugabe can be let off the hook, will NEPAD's peer review process ever work?
The first two countries to be reviewed will be Ghana and South Africa.
The new bacterium, nicknamed “Synthia,” replicates and produces proteins.
By any reasonable definition, it is alive.
The scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute expected to be told that they were “playing God,” and they were not disappointed.
Others have pointed out that, although the team produced a synthetic genome, they put it into a cell from another bacterium, replacing that cell’s DNA.
Life without Doha
Some of the critics are factually ill-informed.
The Bhagwati-Sutherland Report amply documents that much has already been agreed upon in all the major areas.
But why bother to continue trying?
With the former eliminated, the most important institution of global free trade would be crippled.
Light At The End Of Colombia\u0027s Tunnel?
Indeed, agreement on a bilateral cease-fire is expected before April.
Change also took place within the FARC.
So a ``third'' party, as in the wars in El Salvador or Guatemala of the 1980s, became indispensable as a conduit to mediate between the two.
The National Assembly plays a key role in attempting to improve governance in the country.
The international community has a lot at stake in the Congo.
RIO DE JANEIRO – When it comes to all things “green, ” common sense seems to have been abandoned.
When asked to extinguish electric lights, most people around the world would turn to candlelight instead.
Unfortunately, the lights-out campaign exemplifies the state of much of our environmental debate.
For example, the recent breakup of a massive glacier in the Antarctic supposedly proves the mounting effects of global warming.
We don’t hear that the Wilkins glacier makes up less than 0.01% of Antarctica.
In January, Hong Kong was gripped by its second-longest cold spell since 1885.
Nowhere is this clearer than with the lights-out campaign.
Like Father, Like Son
Lincoln, Roosevelt, Churchill...Obama?
There are no new openings in a world of banking and finance brought low by the greed and hubris of some of its key members.
It may be too much to ask from one man.
The Two Rabbits of International Trade
SEOUL – If you chase two rabbits at once, the old saying goes, both will escape.
Furthermore, it fails to encourage more South-South trade.
Among the major multilateral institutions, the WTO maintains jurisdiction over trade.
The two rabbits of international trade can be caught.
Nor did he ever meet a sober deficit-reducing initiative from a Democratic president that he did not oppose with every fiber of his being.
Perhaps Simpson has had a change of heart.
John Berry recently wrote in the online journal The Fiscal Times that not even that is true.
“There is no surplus in there.
It’s a bunch of IOUs,” Berry reports Simpson as having said. “Listen.
Simpson is not making sense.
A General Electric bond is just that – a promise by the General Electric Company to pay its creditors.
As Berry writes: “Alan Greenspan, who headed...[that] commission...would tell Simpson something different.
Perhaps Hamilton was too much the optimist.
What is Italy Saying?
The loss of output in Italy since the beginning of the crisis is as great as it was in the 1930’s.
An alternative set of well-discussed policies could work.
Little Big Men
Smart warriors, however, know how to lead with more than just the use of force.
But some of the most powerful leaders in history, such as Napoleon, Stalin, and Deng Xiaoping were little over five feet tall.
Nature and nurture became thoroughly intertwined.
Yet, the world faces many other vast challenges.
For much less money, we could save 850,000 lives each and every year.
This Saturday, unfortunately, that is not what we’ll hear.
Live Long and Prosper
We thus need a large and liquid market for longevity risk so that these different groups can creatively share their risks with each other.
The result is a world in which power is increasingly distributed rather than concentrated. 
But order will not emerge on its own.
Combating terrorism is also essential if the non-polar era is not to turn into a modern Dark Age.
Living in History
LONDON – I recently took part in a public debate with Paul Keating, Australia’s former prime minister.
This regularly engulfs him in controversy, but it can serve an educational purpose.
Recently, for example, he denounced the idea that Australian sacrifices in the Gallipoli campaign of 1916 during World War I had somehow made and redeemed his nation.
Most countries fabricate at least some of their history; or they simply whitewash the bits that do not match their heroic idea of themselves.
But it was meant for others.
So, when you get history wrong, it can skew your own strategic choices.
First, history teaches you about today as well as yesterday.
The English writer G.K. Chesterton once wrote, “The disadvantage of men not knowing the past is that they do not know the present.”
Living on a Volcano
Likewise, France witnessed riots in Vaux-en-Velin, near Lyon, 20 years ago.
It was the proverbial match thrown by a careless smoker into a parched forest.
Living Under Occupation
by Ralf Dahrendorf
Indeed, in the twelve months following the unconditional surrender of Hitler's Nazi regime in May 1945, I lived under serial Russian, American, and British occupation.
Such enthusiasm did not last long.
In July, when Americans replaced the Soviets in our Berlin district, this changed.
This was even more evident when a few months later my family moved from Berlin to Hamburg, then under British occupation.
In those months, the seeds of my conversion to all things British were planted, which flowered decades later in my becoming a British citizen.
That was different after Germany's Blitzkrieg against Poland.
When my school was sent to the Polish spa in the town of Zakopane, we were obviously enemies, unwanted in every respect.
But the most important aspect of the German experience was the sense of where the occupation would lead.
In the French zone (so I learned later), the signs were less hopeful.
More than that, there were hints of a desire for annexation, with the Saar region actually separated from Germany for a time.
Then one remembers that Popper was writing in the final years of World War II.
In Europe and the West, there is the string of terrorist acts - from those on the US in 2001 to the pre-election bombings in Madrid - to think about.
There is also a widespread sense of economic insecurity.
Even a formula like "war on terror" simplifies a more complex phenomenon.
Such checks can take many forms.
It is not necessary for us to wait for great catastrophes to occur if we can see them coming.
Such islands are not sheltered and protected spaces, but models for others.
Against them, an active effort to tackle the risks around us is the only answer.
Local Science for Large Disasters
The earth produces a reliable stream of disasters.
In 1978, Typhoon Rita wiped out the fleet of handmade wooden fishing boats in a group of sea-dependant Philippine communities.
This scenario has been repeated over and over in diverse contexts.
This philosophy would benefit places like New Orleans as much as Phuket in Thailand.
To be sure, many of these inner-city residents simply lacked the resources to evacuate easily.
The implications of this approach extend far beyond disaster relief.
Germany invented socialism.
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were Germans.
The Social Democratic movement that shaped the modern European welfare state also originated in Germany.
Chinese wages are even lower, at just 4% of the western German average.
Now unemployment is Germany’s biggest problem, standing at a postwar record.
London vs. the Eurozone
In the meantime, the British colonized large portions of the globe.
And so it has proved – though perhaps not in the way he envisaged.
It will make for fascinating viewing in the months and years to come.
MOSCOW – Over the past 18 months, Russia’s relations with Asia have begun to improve.
Some are already up and running.
But an even larger vision is needed.
A modern Asian strategy for Russia – call it “Project Siberia” – should combine Russian political sovereignty with foreign capital and technologies.
Seasonal workers can be brought in from India and Bangladesh.
Of course, such a strategy will require highways, bridges, railways, and seaports.
What makes Project Siberia so efficient is that it benefits everyone.
Look East Again, Europe
It is scattered, sporadic and uncoordinated, leaving many areas uncovered.
Some good news is on the way.
But this will not suffice.
But this is misleading: the European social model is, in fact, part and parcel of the identity of the EU member states more than of the EU per se.
The German example is highly relevant for France and Sarkozy at this critical juncture.
His attacks on ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet were often vicious and quite personal.
Sarkozy’s first foreign trip as France’s new president was to visit Chancellor Merkel.
A new Franco-German axis that makes France more competitive is just what Europe needs.
Members of one extended family within the Dagomb organized the murder of the tribe's own chief.
In Ghana one does not find Ghanaians; one finds Asante, Ewe, Ga, and Dagomb.
Tribes have their dark side, of course.
In Nigeria, the Ibo--who fought Africa's first post-independence war of secession in the name of tribalism--remain an uneasy, defiant minority.
Viewed through the rosy spectacles of nation-statehood, this may look like corruption.
The FraFra live a day's drive from Accra, Ghana's capital, and tend to be overlooked by the national government.
He also insists that the local schools teach the FraFra language.
Only then can members of different tribes interact with each other in a common space--and from a position of strength and respect.
Losing Latin America
Why hasn’t Mexico benefited more from the 1992 North American Free Trade agreement?
By following through on plans to build a 2,000-mile wall across its southern border.
What kind of message does that send to the US’s few remaining allies in the region?
If Americans don’t start embracing their friends in Latin America, it may take a generation to undo the damage.
As White points out, promoters of FDI are not selling a product, which the country’s embassies abroad may be able to do.
Losing Turkey
OXFORD &#45;&#45; Turkey has long been a haven of geo-political stability.
Lost Horizon
Their survey stands as solid scientific evidence in favor of basic research in life sciences.
The answer lies in the nature of scientific mystery.
A recent scientific report belies this notion. 
Last month, the Icelandic biotech company, deCODE Genetics, Inc., published a map of the human genome.
They have a shorter apparent time horizon, and the path towards their goal is apparently clear.
It takes nerve and energy to live like that.
The same happened to the Japanese in real estate.
So how low can the dollar sink?
AMSTERDAM – Western Europe’s small democracies have, on the whole, been exceptionally fortunate.
The most successful political force in Switzerland today is Christoph Blocher’s Swiss People’s Party.
Nor does it share Switzerland’s insularity.
French intellectuals, never shy of public posturing, are campaigning to give her French citizenship.
That, too, is the natural fate of being a lucky little country in Western Europe.
By last year, it had reached $1 trillion.
The whole success story thus was in place in early 1999, one year before Putin entered the stage.
Falsification of elections became the rule.
Life expectancy for men is stuck at 59.
Budget tightening will continue.
For too long, Latin America has practiced the politics of the precipice.
Everyone on the right and left should want that.
Not without reason.
If such people cannot be appeased, or if they panic for no particular reason, then everything goes down the drain.
The suspicion that politicians are inclined to tell lies is as old as politics itself.
Few cases are as clear-cut as that of Anneli Jaatteenmaki, whose short-lived stint as Finland's first woman prime minister recently came to an end.
She had attacked her predecessor during the election campaign for being fork-tongued about Iraq, saying one thing to US President George W. Bush and another to the Finnish people.
Her knowledge was based on Finnish foreign office records.
Had she seen them?
Does it matter whether this claim was strictly true or not?
Trust is a vital commodity for all politicians. Once lost, it is difficult to regain.
Adolf Hitler liked to say that the ultimate cause of the Reichsmark’s stability was the concentration camp.
Markets work by a process of continuous discovery of information.
A year ago, a new strategic arms treaty between Russia and the US was signed in the same city.
Their only concrete proposal is asymmetrical cuts of tactical nuclear weapons by Russia and the US.
The existence of nuclear weapons also curbed the conventional arms race.
America is no less militarily powerful nowadays than previously, but it does not look so strong to the wider world.
Talk about creating regional, cooperative ABM systems might be helpful in preventing the development of long-range missiles by Europe’s neighbors.
Russia will not be able to develop the region on its own.
Madonna and Child
David’s mother is dead.
There, until Madonna came into contact with him, he was living with about 500 other children.
In an interview, David’s father did not deny that his son would be better off with Madonna, and he refused to support the human rights activists seeking David’s return.
His mother tongue will be English; if he ever learns to speak his father’s language, it will be as a foreigner.
But there is a broader issue at stake in David’s case.
In adopting a child from a poor country, Madonna is following an example set by other celebrities like Mia Farrow, Ewan McGregor, and Angelina Jolie.
And, while he was technically the commander-in-chief of the Palestinian forces, these forces lacked the will to stand up to Hamas’s growing power.
Make Politics, Not War, in Iraq
The United States is once again learning the limits of military power.
That won’t work.
Only politics, not arms, can calm the scene. 
Economic aid for poor nations is crucial, because poverty provides the tinder for violence, conflict, and even terrorism.
Vast sums – and millions of lives – would have been saved if that approach had been tried with Ho Chi Minh in the 1950’s.   
But it can’t protect the US from politics.
Three events incited these doubts.
Of course not.
About half of today’s UN members are democracies, the other half non-democracies.
Who should decide if a country is democratic or not?
A tremendously respected independent think tank, Freedom House, is, like the UN’s headquarters, located in New York City.
Freedom House is led and advised by experts on 190 countries.
Political rights and civil liberties are rated between 1 and 7 for each country, with 1 representing the most free and 7 the least free.
So the goal of all free countries should be that only other free countries are allowed seats on the Commission for Human Rights.
Making a Market for Scientific Research
Every government tries to encourage scientific research through education in science.
But education by itself is of only limited use here.
Top scientists, sheltered by anonymity, can usually spot originality and can judge which scientific ideas have real value.
But their support of scientific research was limited to publication.
Problems remain, however, in making newly established peer-review systems work well.
The size of the market for peer review is not the only issue.
Making Culture Count
The Constitution for Europe now being written is no different.
It can only reflect and be animated by them.
The postwar search for affluence, too, has lost much of its allure.
Of course, English is developing into a lingua franca. But as a lingua franca it is limited to serving as a technical or professional language, not the language of a community.
If it is to last, it will not be enough for it to be conceived in the light only of today's experience.
First, certain countries turn specifically to Europe for help.
At the same time, the governments of Chad and the Central African Republic would never have accepted NATO’s intervention to help resolve the Darfur crisis.
The EU also suffers from a well-known lack of capacity in strategic air transport, in-theater air transport, and combat support.
Setting goals was the easy part.
The big development success stories are places like Shanghai, port cities with ready access to world markets.
Communities living in mountainous areas, such as in the Andes, or Central Asia, or the highlands of East Africa, are especially isolated.
Geographical isolation is even more extreme if the country is landlocked, like Bolivia, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, or Burkina Faso.
All of these problems are solvable, but they are not being solved in many places.
Rich countries have promised more help for years, but continue to renege.
Instead, it gives around $15 billion.
But it has not done that.
But the Scandinavian countries have shown that there is another way.
In other words, globalization can be changed; indeed, it is clear that it will be changed.
Making Growth Green
Of the world's species, 12% of birds, 24% of mammals, and 30% of fish are either vulnerable or in immediate danger of extinction.
In these nations, the environment is linked directly to human development - and to poverty.
Funding from developed governments is dropping – a trend that must be reversed.
The Nobel laureates also found that male circumcision is an excellent use of funds.
Because treatment is very expensive, coverage rates remain woefully inadequate.
Making it to the Euro
Debate was heated.
Fourth, it is vital that EU institutions have spoken more openly about the convergence criteria.
But in most cases, entry strategies have been set, serving as important stabilizers for financial markets and economic agents. 
It is almost an optical illusion: looming on Japan’s horizon, and on Europe’s and on America’s, is a pensions crisis.
The costs of managing the Social Security system are far smaller than those likely to be associated with privatized accounts.
This is understandable: private investment firms spend an enormous amount on marketing and salaries.
Moreover, Bush’s proposals won’t fix social security – unless they are accompanied by drastic benefit cuts.
That means less money coming in.
One doesn’t need a Nobel Prize to figure that out.
Even with Social Security’s mildly redistributive effect, poverty and inequality in America are increasing.
Making or Breaking Europe
Do they want a politically integrated Union, perhaps developing eventually into a true federation?
But that may be changing.
This year, or next year, it may at last become clear that the gulf between federalists and nationalists is too deep to be bridged.
Formal negotiations on that draft start next month.
Some middle-sized countries, like Spain and Poland, do not like the proposed majority voting rules, which would operate according to population weights.
Neutrals, like Finland and Austria, are opposed to plans for closer defense cooperation.
They were not voting against the Euro, they were voting against more Europe.
The same is true of Britain.
Making Peace Between Darwinism and Christianity
Evolutionary ideas are born of religion.
The ancient Greeks had no idea of progress, directional time, and linear history, culminating in humankind.
The eye, for example, is like a telescope.
Since telescopes have telescope makers, the eye must have an eye maker--the Great Optician in the Sky.
Without natural selection, the appeal to God made sense.
The universe presented by organized religions is a poky little medieval universe, and extremely limited."
Now, I, for one, am not quite sure how poky the medieval universe actually was.
You may not  have to be a Christian in the light of Darwinism, but this does not mean that you  cannot be one.
True, he demands a special intervention for the arrival of human souls, but souls (if such there be) are hardly scientific concepts anyway.
People like Dawkins, and the Creationists for that matter, make a mistake about the purposes of science and religion.
Science tries to tell us about the physical world and how it works.
Science asks immediate questions.
There is no conflict here, except when people mistakenly think that questions from one domain demand answers from the other.
It is not a pretty solution, but it is the only one.
The United States’ National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration has issued its “State of the Climate Report” covering January-May.
The first five months of this year were the warmest on record going back to 1880.
May was the warmest month ever.
The individuals involved in this campaign are not only scientifically uninformed, but show absolutely no interest in becoming better informed.
This was unavoidable, because the Maastricht Treaty was meant to bring about a monetary union without a political union.
That is how the divergences emerged.
That was the start of the euro crisis.
Unfortunately, it is equally certain that the new arrangements will also be flawed.
The authorities are confronted by not only a currency crisis, but also a banking crisis and a crisis in macroeconomic theory.
The authorities are committing at least two mistakes.
Markets recognize this, which is why the Irish rescue brought no relief.
This would create a European regulatory regime.
Making the IMF and World Bank Work for the Poor
They account for 44% of people living with HIV/AIDS, 47% of global CO2 emissions, and 52% of the planet’s protected natural areas.
But it cannot be the sole purpose of international aid, nor of the World Bank.
Its products need to be adapted.
The UN Charter was, above all, a manifesto of nations committed to freedom and justice.
We must modify not only the working mechanisms of the UN, but also its composition.
Such a UN could follow the organizational model of the WTO, for example, or the Council of Europe.
The UN must be re-founded on the basis of its original principles.
Malaya and Sri Lanka: Communal Politics or Communal War?
Back then, Malaysia's ethnic tensions produced communal riots in which both Chinese and Malays were killed.
Could Sri Lanka have learned anything from the Malayan experience?
Indeed, at the time Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) achieved independence, it was far more committed to democracy and the common-law legal system than Malaya.
Sadly, the Tamils now living in the Jaffna districts in the northern and eastern parts of the island are probably descended from Tamils who were also victims of the same external attacks.
Malaysia Goes Islamic
Hence, it is no longer accurate to think of the PAS as a fundamentalist party and the UMNO as moderate.
The UMNO, meanwhile, is intent on dividing the opposition coalition, of which the PAS is a member.
Most are anti-UMNO and support the PAS.
Malaysia’s Opposition Reborn
But, before all that, Anwar needs to get himself elected to parliament again.
For the same reason, policy platforms have never been important for the opposition in elections.
(Kelantan state, however, was always expected to continue to be held by PAS.)
Man, Machine, and in Between
TÜBINGEN, GERMANY ­– We are so surrounded by gadgetry nowadays that it is sometimes hard to tell where devices end and people begin.
These signals are then used to predict what a user intends to do.
Who is responsible for involuntary acts?
Is it the fault of the computer or the user?
Brain-machine interfaces represent a highly sophisticated case of tool use, but they are still just that.
But what if machines change the brain?
None of the new technologies warrants changing that approach.
To them, cochlear implants are an enhancement beyond normal functioning.
Distinguishing between enhancement and treatment requires defining normality and disease, which is notoriously difficult.
For example, Christopher Boorse, a philosopher at the University of Delaware, defines disease as a statistical deviation from “species-typical functioning.”
From this perspective, cochlear implants seem ethically unproblematic.
We should take such concerns seriously, but they should not prevent further research on brain-machine interfaces.
Man or Monster?
This was Duch’s place.
This alleged perpetrator of unspeakable misdeeds is, like his victims, someone’s son, someone’s brother, someone’s father.
Man’s Fate/Man’s Hope
But that is not the whole story.
For them, the most important features of what our experience may instead be:
The gargantuan container ships that first appeared a generation ago brought one revolution to world trade.
It will take at least a generation for these changes to make themselves felt in most corners of the world.
An eight-lane highway must carry traffic to generate tolls.
But the question remains: will output growth continue following the transfer of sovereignty to an Iraqi government at the end of June?
Good fortune and bad fortune alternate randomly, and the poorest people are particularly vulnerable when misfortune – like a hurricane in a fishing village – strikes.
The farmer may even plant a crop that he knows will fail.
But insurance technology is improving, aided by improved information technology.
Since the farmer cannot influence the weather, there is no moral hazard.
Crops are especially vulnerable at certain times, for example, when seeds begin germinating or when bad weather the previous year puts perennials at risk.
Managing the Earth
Our only defenses against a hostile world were primitive stone tools and fire - a minimal kind of protection at best. 
Then, about 10,000 years ago, something extraordinary happened.
You can decide to mow the grass, in which case you produce one kind of ecosystem, one kind of future.
In fact, our relation to the planet will be like that of a gardener to a garden.
There is no easy solution to these problems.
It promises to be an interesting, lively, and significant debate.
Getting Cities Right
In many respects, urbanization is rational.
Manufacturing Scientific Uncertainty
For decades, the tobacco industry manufactured more than just cigarettes.
Scientists cannot feed toxic chemicals to people, for example, to see what doses cause cancer.
And the media were prohibited from reporting cases involving land disputes and forced evictions.
Mao, the False God
Should Chairman Mao’s huge portrait still hang above the front gate of Tiananmen Square?
Should China’s ruling party still call itself Communist?
But how “correct” was Mao?
Mao launched the Cultural Revolution (1965-76) to take revenge against those who opposed his mad programs.
Millions more died.
Mao also ordered the country to destroy the “Four Olds”: old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits.
What about today’s “New New China,” with its skyscrapers, modern highways, and unbridled capitalism?
China’s communist rulers must own up to their history and drop Mao and the communist legacy.
This is especially true of our flawed heroes, as we see today with the Chinese Communist Party’s treatment of Mao Zedong.
Sixty years ago this October, Mao stood on the rostrum of Tiananmen, the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Beijing, and declared the founding of the People’s Republic.
It is an intimate part of their family stories.
They regarded returning as their patriotic duty.
The family sacrificed everything.
The family lived in penury.
She witnessed the return of the greed and corruption that she believed had destroyed the Kuomintang in the 1930’s and 1940’s.
This creed has clearly not survived its creator.
Mao made China proud.
He is a hero of happiness.
His battles were in a decidedly popular art.
Now that he's no longer playing football, Argentines demand even more.
He likes to proclaim, "I'm only a football player.
I'm no role model for anyone."
The Iron Lady as Liberator
Then she dared to enter the exclusive male preserve of politics.
The record speaks for itself.
Thatcherism’s Bellicose Soul
A conviction is a settled belief that brooks no argument.
“In victory, magnanimity,” Winston Churchill advised.
As a result, she failed to create harmony out of discord.
In instinct and language, she was a follower of Friedrich von Hayek.
Her missionary zeal fell on deaf ears.
Her “right to buy” policy triggered an upward spiral in house prices, which encouraged households to take on more and more debt.
In a recent article in the British scientific journal The Lancet , Oliver Sabot and I proposed such a strategy.
Most importantly, these countries are not surrounded by malaria.
This strategy has begun to emerge organically, without prompting from the global community.
In the Pacific, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands, at the far southeastern margin of the malaria endemic zone, have embarked on an eradication campaign with support from the Australian government.
But that is possible only if, this time, the “big bazooka” really is put in place.
Mario Monti on Trial
But, like the fight against subsidies to businesses, these are battles that are directed against state intervention, not private companies.
The Commission is authorized to open a case against a proposed merger and to decide on it.
The Bank of England’s Knockout Artist
LONDON – In Canada, if you say you come from London, the natives often ask if you mean London, Ontario, or London, England.
But soon, perhaps, they will no longer need to ask: in London, we are all Canadians now.
These are heady times at the BoE (in the heart of the financial district of Ontario-on-Thames).
Though it all sounded straightforward, markets were confused.
Their views have often been split in recent years.
But individual voting remains in place, so Carney is not in sole charge of policymaking, as he was at the Bank of Canada.
That would be fun to watch.
The fourth problem is the most fundamental.
But one would surely not start from there if that were the long-term policy aim.
Market Solutions, the Environment, and Morocco
The demand for edible argan oil likewise expanded rapidly.
It now graces the menus of upscale restaurants in New York, London, and Paris.
What went wrong?
The benefits to local people have been largely derivative, due to the higher prices mechanical processors pay for fruit.
After all, locals are more apt to invest in enclosures to protect their mature trees, while ignoring the need to tend to trees in village commons.
Indeed, the process of commercialization can readily induce changes in production, processing, and distribution that exclude the poor.
Marketing Nationalism in China
From the Chinese perspective, of course, the blame falls on the Japanese government for its reluctance to apologize for the crimes Japan committed in WW II.
Nationalism has been a prominent element in Chinese media in recent years.
The main concern was not attracting readers, listeners, and viewers, but avoiding political mistakes.
Radio and TV enjoyed the same built-in audience.
In the 30 years following the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, no media outlet ran even a single commercial advertisement.
One is government corruption.
In some cases, they are shut down.
The chief executive issued his order accordingly.
A cascade of declines in other countries immediately followed.
In Moscow, the RTSI index was down by 3.3% at its closing bell.
In London, the FTSE 100 was off by 2.3% when trading ended that day.
Moreover, two weeks later, all these markets outside of China were down from 4.3% to 7.8% compared to their close on February 26.
Newspapers the next day described it as “one of the severest declines the market has ever gone through,” and “the worst money scare since July 1, 1920.”
On each occasion, newspaper accounts further established the 1929 market psychology.
The historical parallels do not stop there.
On September 11, 1986, the Dow dropped 4.6%, the steepest one-day decline since May 28, 1962.
Disputes between the United States and Europe are nothing new, as past tensions over Korea, Suez, and Vietnam demonstrate.
The Cold War’s end changed everything.
Cooperation is possible. In 1990, Europeans and Americans joined forces to reverse Iraq’s invasion and occupation of Kuwait.
Europeans, too, have special responsibilities.
The latter is inconsistent with being an ally.
We are entering a new and different era of US-European relations.
The Greek Budget Myth
More generally, the national debt of any country grows by the size of its budget deficit or declines by the size of its budget surplus.
The program was therefore formally launched on October 1.
With this in mind, Obamacare’s drafters made the purchase of insurance “mandatory.”
Marxism, Back From the Grave in Uruguay
MONTEVIDEO: Across Latin America, comrades and caudillos are supposedly consigned to the dustbin of history.
Jorge Batlle, taking office as President March 1, must bear this in mind.
Suspense gripped the country.
No one knew.
What incited the Left's rise?
All this was long ago.
In 1915 it mandated the first 48-hour week seen anywhere in the world.
The elder Batlle was revered in his lifetime and beyond.
His faction eventually absorbed the entire Colorado Party.
Since his election, he has said little more.
NEWPORT BEACH – August is traditionally Europe’s holiday month, with many government officials taking several weeks off.
This year, there is another reason why Europe has pressed the pause button for August.
At the end of July, the widely watched indicator of European manufacturing activity crossed the threshold signaling expansion for only the second time in 23 months.
If officials do not return quickly to addressing economic challenges in a more comprehensive manner, the current calm may give way to renewed turmoil.
Finally, little oxygen is flowing to the private sector.
While Europe has succeeded in stabilizing its sovereign-bond markets, financial intermediation for small and medium-size enterprises remains highly disrupted.
Europe’s external environment is not helping, either.
And Europe is a leading indicator of this.
However, this prohibition does not apply to people who are self-employed or not working.
Immigrants have crowded out domestic residents who prefer the benefits to engaging in low-wage competition with the newcomers.
There is still time to avert these frightening effects.
WASHINGTON, DC – Whatever the outcome of the United States’ presidential election, climate change policy will be transformed.

Now that it has, how far can the flames spread?
Given the easy availability of these technologies, their ability to catalyze protest might transcend borders once thought impregnable.
Or, when necessary, they can simply turn them off.
All three arrived like bolts from the blue.
Threats to the wealthier Persian Gulf states, in particular, are exaggerated.
Bahrain, the world’s only Shia-majority country governed by a Sunni monarch, remains on edge.
Nor does Iran’s government appear to face real danger.
A new chapter has begun.
But we must never overestimate the ability of new governments to solve old problems – or underestimate the ingenuity and brutality of the old regimes.
He is a big fan of 1970’s rockers Deep Purple.
In 1996, the enemy was the Communists; in 1999-2000, the Chechens; in 2003-04, the “oligarchs.”
One of the key achievements of the European Union is mobility of goods and inputs. Without this, what kind of a union would the EU be?
The real question is whether there is a disease at all.
In fact, estimates of potential migration flows from East to West are relatively small.
But New York and Los Angeles, the two most ethnically diverse cities in the US, are also America's leaders in business and in the arts.
In 1990, Tudor set up a weekly magazine through which he incited vicious and reactionary campaigns.
Tudor subsequently finished second in the presidential election.
At the local elections held in June, the PRM did poorly.
But no one should be fooled.
LONDON – It’s 1946.
Obama has also issued an apology to the people of Guatemala.
So, too, she found, was the previously unknown Guatemalan experiment.
The US prosecutors at Nuremberg didn’t know about the Guatemala experiments, so there’s no allegation of deliberate hypocrisy.
Could such a thing happen again?

This view reflects an even older tradition that goes back to the mercantilist practices of the seventeenth century.
Early mercantilism deserves a rethink too.
If she succeeds, she will emerge as the first great European leader of the twenty-first century.
It also has more than 7,500 enterprises operating in China, with gross investment totaling $18.5 billion.
Lying at two ends of that monetary triangle, the eurozone and China have acquired a geopolitical stake in helping each other.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has appeared to be the embodiment of the new strength of old Europe’s problem child, a country admired by some and hated by others.
Both parties are successors to the Catholic German Center Party, which fought against Protestant predominance in Prussia and Bismarck’s Reich.
What happened?
Quite simply, the FDP ditched her and changed sides on a critical issue, aligning itself with the main opposition parties in supporting Gauck.
Not so this time.
The exchange rate would be gone, Mexico would be (almost) like Texas or New Jersey in its link to the dollar.
Mexico Breaking Good?
Most of the characters on the US side of the border are portrayed with sympathy and depth.
This last reform is critical, because much of Mexico’s geology is very similar to that of the southwestern US.
It wouldn’t be the first time.
Traversing extremely rough terrain with 200 tunnels and bridges, it promises to cut the transit time by three or four hours.
Except for the weather, the highway has the feel of Switzerland.
Unfortunately, early anecdotal evidence suggests that these safeguards may ultimately slow down traffic by roughly the same amount of time that the project was meant to speed it up!
One simple step would be to restrict the circulation of $100 bills, which are mostly used in the underground economy.
The US stands to benefit as much as Mexico if conditions south of the border begin breaking good.
Mexico\u0027s Labyrinth of Uncertainty
But they find it equally likely that their living standards might drop even lower than they are today.
This mixture of optimism and fear applies to everyone, Mexican businesses and Mexican families alike.
The 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Mexico, the US, and Canada helped Mexico's economy recover quickly from the 1994-95 peso crisis.
Mexicans' obsession with China is no accident.
No party has a majority in the Chamber of Deputies.
"Is anything wrong?" I ask.

Nowadays, it relies more on psychological coercion and control than on discrimination or physical constraints.
In a sense, machismo has gone underground.
Women may be considered equal in many areas, but men remain more equal.
In Mexico, women's time is not their own.
How can we continue to be governed by men who have never set foot in a supermarket?"

NAFTA came into force on January 1, 1994.
Of course expertise is only part of the story of good governance.
Part of the problem, alas, may lie beyond Mexico’s control.
America’s insatiable demand for cocaine has made Mexico a transit route from South American producers.
Mexico’s Next Revolution
Calderón ran on Fox’s coat-tails, but without any Fox entourage, and he won… big-time.
Nonetheless the challenges he faces are enormous.
These are the most important and urgent reforms.
Sometimes no reform is better than the wrong type of reform.
Unfortunately, the attack on the IFE’s autonomy is not an isolated event in Latin America.
Mexico now seems poised to join this dubious club.
But it is not reasonable to do so by proposing a cure that is worse than the disease.
Mexico Steps Beyond the Labyrinth of Solitude
They don't know whether to love them or hate them, support them or denounce them, foster a close relationship or remain distant neighbors.
By opposing a resolution that was unacceptable, Mexico helped craft one that was acceptable.
But Mexico today does have interests--including the price of oil--and being on the Security Council allows it to defend them.
Mexico should show that it is possible to be in favor of multilateralism without being against the US.
The US is in a partial recovery, with growth at 1.5-2% and lagging employment.
In such economies, that pattern not only typically depended on leverage; it also enlarged the non-tradable side of the economy and shrank the tradable side.
Microbiology\u0027s World Wide Web
All the fashionable talk nowadays about computer “viruses” explains what these culprits do by forging an analogy to their biological namesakes.
But it is equally enlightening to portray the biosphere of real, living microbes as a world wide web of informational exchange.
It is the microbe’s capacity to transfer information to other organisms that makes the analogy with the World Wide Web plausible.
The sheer number of microbes and their ability to exchange information is a formula for high-speed evolution.
Indeed, many complex species lost the war with microbes to become extinct.
But, of course, neither would many microbes have survived, because they depend on other species for their habitat.
Middle East Integration
“Ripeness is all,” concludes Edgar in King Lear .
I will leave it to Shakespeare scholars to decipher what he had in mind.
There is also a question of process.
His coalition government survives mainly because many members of Israel’s parliament know that they would lose their seats in an early election.
For some, this approach will seem overly modest.
This is one such occasion.
For starters, we are again moving into what Henry Kissinger called the realm of “constructive ambiguity.”
Mitchell gave a similar invitation to Abbas.
To succeed, the post-2015 agenda must break the original mold.
It must be grounded in a fuller narrative about how development occurs – a narrative that accounts for complex issues such as migration.
It has been with us since the dawn of mankind, and its economic impact today is massive.
The list goes on.
They go from north to south, south to north, south to south, and north to north.
Mikhail Gorbachev and the End of the Cold War
By November, the Berlin Wall had fallen.
In the early Cold War, communism and the Soviet Union had considerable soft power.
According to one Soviet economist, by the late 1980’s, only 8% of Soviet industry was globally competitive.
It is difficult for a country to remain a superpower when the world doesn’t want 92% of what it produces.
Militarizing the Andes
Indeed, Colombia is now the fifth largest recipient of US aid in the world.
On the contrary, since 2005, the FARC has been escalating its attacks.
In fact, this “model” is already being applied in the region.

Recall the photographs of Herman Goering and Rudolf Hess sitting glumly in the dock at Nuremberg.
The trial of Saddam Hussein and his Ba’athist cronies offers an ongoing series of embarrassments.
The defendants try one antic after another, and Hussein shows every form of contempt possible except “mooning” the judge.
In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government have dickered for almost a decade about how to bring surviving Khmer Rouge figures to trial.
The ICTY did make several foundational decisions under the leadership of Antonio Cassese.
In the South African proceedings the most important question was not the future of the defendant but the past of the victims.
Ironically, it was an advantage of the Nuremberg courts that they were staffed by the representatives of the victorious powers.
Undoubtedly, some truth exists here.
But take, for example, last week's confrontation between Milosevic and Paddy Ashdown.
So Serbs now ask why no Albanian guerilla is on trial.
Again, Serbs ask, why wasn't Tudjman ever indicted and why, when he died in 1999, did Western diplomats attend his funeral.
Milosevic, the former president of Yugoslavia, and then Serbia, died in prison.
Charles Taylor was President of Liberia when the Tribunal for Sierra Leone indicted him.
Milton Friedman’s Magical Thinking
What Adam Smith was to the eighteenth century, Milton Friedman was to the twentieth.
In effect, he presented government as the enemy of the market.
Markets are the essence of a market economy in the same sense that lemons are the essence of lemonade.
Pure lemon juice is barely drinkable.
Since 1980, the world has witnessed a widening income gap among developing countries.
In Senegal, simmering violence accompanied recent elections in which President Abdoulaye Wade was allowed to stand for an unprecedented third term.
Likewise, AU President Jean Ping condemned a coup in Guinea-Bissau in early April immediately and in the strongest terms.

Indeed, I suspect that the people who need Digital Mirror the most are the ones who will recognize that need the least.
Digital Mirror does the reverse.
But Facebook does not show that information to you.
Digital Mirror does.
But right now, only Digital Mirror is one of the few to give you the ability to do the same for yourself.
Third, America underestimated the role of public opinion in Poland and the Czech Republic.
This approval cannot be taken for granted.
Missiles, Oil, and Europe Re-Divided
Putin’s policies are popular in Russia, which of course does not make them right.
But we are light years away from a new Cold War.
Eleven defensive US missiles in Poland will not threaten Russia's security.
Indeed, it increasingly resembles a chicken farm after a fox has broken in.
And now, with the US announcement that it will build the anti-missile defense system on a bilateral basis with Poland and the Czech Republic, there is also a hawk circling overhead.
All the while, Moscow is playing a game of “divide and rule” by exploiting Europe’s dependence on Russian oil and gas supplies.
What we need now is a “Europe of Common Interests.”
SAN JOSÉ, COSTA RICA – One commonly repeated argument for doing something about climate change sounds compelling, but turns out to be almost fraudulent.
The president of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, for example, used this argument when he presented the European Union’s proposal to tackle climate change earlier this year.
First, most of the 47% pay a great deal of tax on their earnings, property, and goods purchased.
Seen in broad historical perspective, this is not such an unusual situation.
The traditional mechanism of state capture in much of the world is violence.
But that is not true in the United States.
Their success has paid off handsomely.
Events in the days leading up to America’s presidential election provided a stark illustration of the struggle.
Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, had expressed belief in the reality of global warming.
It did.
Eight weeks later, Hurricane Sandy struck the New Jersey shore and New York City.
Is this just petty politics, or does it really matter?
For example, the financial crisis that began in 2008 demonstrated the need for adequate regulation.
He is right.
Models of Madness
Ignoring other people’s feelings (once called being naughty) means that the child is suffering from “conduct disorder.”
If this includes getting angry at grownups, he or she (usually he) has “oppositional defiant disorder.”
If we just accept the diagnosis on offer, nobody is to blame.
Growth was fastest from 1870-1890, followed by large fluctuations in output.
Growth of per capita income decelerated between 1902 and 1930 and declined further in the last fifteen years of British rule until 1947.

WASHINGTON, DC – 2008 will be remembered as a year of extraordinary turmoil.
We need a “human” rescue as well as a financial rescue.
At the World Bank Group, we are scaling up our financial support for those in need.
How can this be done?
In 2008, they were called upon to fix financial-market dysfunction before it tipped the world into Great Depression II.
It is in no one’s interest to see these critical institutions come crashing down.
Egypt’s Monster in the Making
A succession of dictator-presidents ruled the country under a state of emergency for more than 40 years.
Hundreds have been injured in street clashes in Cairo.
Egypt can thrive only on the basis of honest adherence to a democratic process.
The problem is missed connections, so the solution is to make more of them.
But such synchronization will not be easy to achieve.
One-third of employers never interact with education providers, while only 15% do so once a month or more.
Monetary Policy and European Growth
Millions more have dropped out of the measured labor force altogether.
And about a quarter of 16-19-year-olds in the labor force are unemployed.
In fact, I have scrupulously abided by both the letter and the spirit of the law.
Moreover, I don't seek such influence.
This bill should be supported.
Free airtime for candidates is also important.
It is important that people know where financial support is coming from.
MOSCOW: A big squeeze is on in Moscow, as President Putin seeks to drill the country's wayward regions into line with Kremlin policies.
And I have not even mentioned such minor things as tax reform, pension reform, and privatizing land ownership.
Despite all this, it is boasted that Russia's economy is rebounding.
A new president, however, means a new beginning, the right time to sort out the rot.
I am not sure that President Putin will assemble a talented government.
Over the years, Western aid came with a double standard.
What they must do is simple:
Propose only policies Western governments would follow themselves.
No double standards.
The Beatles used to sing that "Money can't buy love."
Money for Nothing
This increase has no separate climate effect, since we’ve already promised to cut emissions by 20%.
Also, high oil prices have taken a toll on disposable income, impeding growth in consumption demand.
If not as old as ancient Rome, it certainly goes as far back as the tenth-century Holy Roman Empire.
The other ideal was eternal peace.
In 1713, another Catholic Frenchman, Charles-Irénée Castel, abbé de Saint-Pierre, published his Project for Perpetual Peace in Europe.
In this, too, he was a man of his time.
When people lose faith in democratic institutions to protect them, they will reach for extremism.
But its legitimacy cracks as soon as a crisis erupts.
Was it all really truthful?
Unfortunately, there is no way to find out.
Policymakers can provide only general responses, not deal with all cases individually.
Consider investors in Fannie and Freddie bonds.
How can this be fair?
The measure was, at least initially, opposed by the Conservative government, but supported by members of all political parties.
But that is implausible, given that Buddhist tradition places more emphasis on concern for animals than Judaism, Christianity, or Islam.
One recent sign again concerns circuses.
In January 2013, keeping breeding sows in individual stalls will also be prohibited.
The United States lags behind Europe in getting rid of the worst forms of abuse of farm animals.
LONDON – After World War I, H.G. Wells wrote that a race was on between morality and destruction.
Economic writing, however, conveyed a completely different world.
Here technology was deservedly king.
Traditional morality faded away as technology multiplied productive power.
Our faith in the market – for the market is the midwife of technological invention – was a result of this.
This was the main achievement of mathematical economics.
The main uncertainty in life – the destination of one’s immortal soul – nudges one toward morality.
H.G. Wells was only partly right: the race between morality and destruction encompasses not just war, but economic life as well.
But criticism of the IMF not only comes from the American right.
The IMF has become a household word, but one with unfavorable connotations.
Turkey today is a case in point, or Russia, or Asia in 1997-98.
More Walls to Fall
The East-West arms race had created an explosive situation.
Today, another planetary threat has emerged.
There is not just one wall to topple, but many.
Morocco’s Veiled Feminists
For these activists, such linkages were intended to maintain control over women, and were part of Moroccan society, not Islam.
The growing significance of the veil also highlighted important differences between men and women in Morocco.
Re-visiting traditional interpretations of Scripture is not the end of the story.
Moscow and the Middle East
Russia has long had the upper hand in Turkmenistan.
Motor City Meltdown
Additionally, the Big Three are vital to national security, supplying important military transportation assets.
All of this is true.
Now, they are failing to understand the financial significance of the Big Three.
All of this must be fixed.
But sacrificing the Big Three automakers will accomplish nothing while risking a tragic economic depression.
Economic growth averaged 7.2% between 1999 and 2008.
Indeed, he quotes Catherine the Great: “Freedom is the soul of everything.
What this line of research explicitly does not tell us is that deleveraging will restore growth by itself.
Consider southern Europe.
If the assumption or the model is wrong, so is the estimate.
Then there is the time dimension.
At one point, the project – which is also part of a massive art installation – refers to the history of a village: local teenagers recount that, “Soldiers once occupied this place.
Poetry, by South Korean director Lee Chang-Dong, also deals with a family reconciling themselves through pain to a prior conflict.
It tells the story of an elderly woman who is forced to face her past as a torturer.
Other films address a conflict that is closer to home here in France.
Outside the Law, directed by Rachid Bouchareb, narrates the story of the massacre at Setif, Algeria, in May 1945.
Other films simply tell stories of people who are not usually portrayed by film.
What does it all mean?
CAIRO – August 3, 2011, will be remembered as a historic day in Egypt.
But in Egypt, “It was done exclusively by Egyptians for Egypt,” as a friend put it to me.
But the run-up to the trial was contentious.
As a result, many secular activists ended their week-long sit-in and withdrew from Tahrir Square.
Chants of “islamiyya, islamiyya” (Islamic, Islamic) were enough.
It worked.
The secularists’ gains were a wake-up call for the Islamists, and they responded en masse on July 29.
Popular support does.
Egyptian and other Arab revolutionaries should therefore keep the lessons of July 29 and August 3 in minds.
Muddling Out of Freefall
Indeed, on the other side of the United States from Massachusetts, voters in Oregon passed a referendum supporting a tax increase.
Energy security is at the top of the agenda of the G-8 meeting hosted by President Vladimir Putin in Saint Petersburg.
As a result, OPEC’s share of world oil exports dropped sharply in the twelve years following the embargo of 1973-1974. 
Immediate multilateral intervention by the European Union and the United States probably are what probably caused Gazprom to turn the gas back on. 
The Muppet empire is now worldwide.
The co-production has ended.
And the creators of these programs, together with the filmmakers behind “When Muppets Dream of Peace,” offer important lessons for all of us.
In the 1970’s in the United States, they taught us about an interracial couple on Sesame Street.
Two accounts, both broadly socio-political, stand out.
He blames French society.
He was inspired by al-Qaeda.
Although no one would argue that Anders Breivik is insufficiently Norwegian, he, too, could be taken at his word.
In that case, people blamed the sadistic video games and movies that the killers had been watching.
Breivik had fantasies of being a knight fighting the enemies of the West.
Merah imagined that he was a jihadi.
Censorship is unlikely to solve the problem.
Banning Hitler’s Mein Kampf or forbidding the display of Nazi symbols has not stopped neo-Nazis in Germany from murdering immigrants.
Suppressing violent pornography will not get rid of rapists or high-school killers.
General Musharraf is the third Pakistani general in fifty years to seize power proclaiming a self-anointed reform agenda.
All countries have armies, but in Pakistan the army has a country.
Retired officers head many, if not most, public corporations.
It was, after all, a different historical epoch.
All of this in the name of "reform," of course.
Instead, he cultivated a reputation as an anti-Indian hardliner.
If Musharraf had previously been unwilling to choose sides, the attempts to kill him finally showed him which side he had to be on.
From then on, Musharraf seems genuinely to have tried to clamp down on the Frankenstein’s monster that he had sustained as an instrument of Pakistani policy.
Musharraf’s Last Act?
His goal?
Operations there against Taliban and al-Qaeda forces brought mixed results.
My Body, My Capital?
Plastic surgery, the implantation of biochips, piercings – all emblazon the belief that our bodies are our unique property.
In the absence of a belief in eternal life, everything becomes invested in this life, this body.
Women’s bodies are used to sell everything from cars to pop music, of course.
By contrast, genetic patenting, which affects both sexes, has (rightly) generated a huge scholarly literature and a very vigorous popular debate.
Just a coincidence?
My Journey with Che
"Pioneros por el comunismo, seremos como el Che!
Che's life and deeds all became part of a modern bible for young Cubans.
I wanted to sit with him for a beer and a cigarette to talk about his love for chess or his favorite books.
Today, a photo of Che's image displayed on the façade of Cuba's Interior Ministry is a must-have for tourists.
An archetype feeding the legend?
A favorite leader?
The bailout of the motor industry ought to be the exception, not the rule.
The euro staged an explosive rally, but the rally was short lived because the eurozone developed its own internal difficulties.
Is Ireland’s credit good enough?
Consumption as a share of GDP has to fall.
All these are negative influences.
What is to be expected on the positive side?
Reduced military expenditures.
But even with the best policies, domestic growth is liable to lag behind the global economy.
China
That will not be easy for either side.
China has much to lose.
It is not a democracy, and there is no established routine for changing governments.
The Indian Subcontinent
Yet they cannot be defeated without the active support of the local population.
Dubai was the world’s most spectacular real estate bubble and will have to be rescued by the deep pockets of Abu Dhabi.
By and large, the first group is more sophisticated and more Western-oriented: it keeps its money and its children abroad.
Europe
Russia could divide and conquer, as it is doing already.&nbsp;
The EU has a common currency and the ECB, but it does not have a common fiscal policy or treasury.
Others, such as South Africa and Turkey, suffer from serious power outages.

NEW YORK – The last fast-food hamburger you ate may have cost you next to nothing.
But they often were not allowed to start picking until 2-3 hours later, when the dew on the plants dried – time for which they were not paid.
Without such programs, the multinational squeeze goes on.
(Though four of the five largest US fast-food corporations have signed on to the FFP, Wendy’s is the holdout.)
Activists say that calling that number elicits a form-letter statement, and that no one ever speaks with them directly.
Nationalism and Terrorism
And yet two different American administrations have implied – and consistently acted upon – this assumption.
And no historical acumen is needed to understand that nationalism was the source of Hitler’s National Socialism and, therefore, World War II.
To no longer be “Number One” would offend America’s sense of dignity.
There is no more to it than that.
China is now also motivated by nationalism, and it will rise as high as a motivated population of 1.3 billion people can.
Being blind to the connection between nationalism and dignity in China – and in America’s own conduct when dealing with China – may cost the US even more.
NATO After Istanbul
In Istanbul, we not only reinforced the alliance's vital transatlantic link, but also built bridges of cooperation to other regions.
The key decisions that we took at the summit make this very clear.
Third, the Balkans.
But NATO will retain a presence in Sarajevo, in particular to help Bosnia and Herzegovina with defense reform.
Fourth, military transformation.
Finally, the Mediterranean and the broader Middle East.
NATO after Riga
Yet a few weeks ago, NATO held its summit meeting in the Latvian capital of Riga, formerly part of the USSR.
NATO was created in 1949 as an alliance to contain Soviet power.
In fact, Russian officers are welcome to participate in military exercises and to visit NATO headquarters under the Partnership for Peace program.
A common quip was that NATO would have to go “out of area or out of business.”
At the same time, NATO after Riga faces a number of problems.
Unfortunately, Iraq is draining all the oxygen out of the policy process in Washington.
NATO and Romania\u0027s Nightmares
But we need up-to-date aircraft ... to join NATO.'
Bulgaria is too small to matter; and Yugoslavia's wars are over.
Romania's security problems are not external, but internal, for the enemies of Romania establishing a stable, democratic-liberal government are the Romanian people themselves.
How can NATO help with this?
NATO is no longer only a military alliance.
Instead, it is now a military-political alliance that sets democratic standards for new members and aspirants.
No Romanian government can neglect these standards.
So, it is not joining NATO the military alliance that will benefit Romania.
It was a classic strategy/policy mismatch.
The nineteenth-century Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz is (too) often cited for his dictum that war is a continuation of politics by other means.
Nor can it be an option today.
The policy is to remove Qaddafi from power.
The strategy – that is, the mandate for the means – is to protect civilians.
The latter will not ensure the success of the former.
NATO’s Dangerous Signals
But no: 1989 was not the end of history.
European opponents of a MAP for Ukraine and Georgia argue that neither country is ready for NATO membership.
But the MAP process does not imply an automatic right to NATO membership.
NATO is supposed to be a beacon for countries struggling to establish democracy and freedom.
The Bucharest summit suggests that the beacon has been switched off.
NATO\u0027s Transformation
NATO will pass this test.
But this job is not yet complete.
That is why, at Prague, we will invite additional countries to join.
At Prague, we will make them even more effective.
At Prague, this message will ring out loud and clear.
Nato to Lebanon – but on one condition
In addition, these risks vary widely across countries, including countries whose current credit ratings suggest similar levels of sovereign risk.
Naturalized Killers
But what do we really know about these killers among us?
Immigrants can establish themselves in new societies, and in democratic states they can live completely free of supervision.
Our freedoms are their tools.
Simply put, bombs dropped from several thousands meters do not kill less indiscriminately than explosive charges placed in train cars.
Man's relationship to nature is a theme as old as our species, but that relationship is changing in complex ways.
Part of the growing climate effect results from our sheer numbers.
These growing environmental risks are complex.
Or the effects may be indirect.
The summit in Johannesburg can draw the world's attention to these pressing problems.
Need Versus Greed
China’s economy is growing at around 10% annually.
Overall, the developing countries are growing at around 7% per year, and the developed economies at around 2%, yielding a global average of around 4.5%.
We see these pressures every day in the marketplace.
In some places in India, the water table has been falling by several meters annually in recent years.
Some deep wells are approaching the point of exhaustion, with salinity set to rise as ocean water infiltrates the aquifer.
A calamity is inevitable unless we change.
And here is where Gandhi comes in.
But they are often needed.
Hindus, Christians, or Buddhists lack such a cause, which is why political terrorism is largely confined to Muslims.
There is no quick or easy way out of this problem, especially in bad economic times.
Neighbors
It is a country that we call Israel and they call Palestine.
One and a half million people live in Gaza.
The men and women of Gaza are our neighbors and have lived back to back with us for a long time, even if we are separated from them by a border.
Our homes and our cities are just a few kilometers from each other, our fields brush up against theirs.
They are our neighbors, and they will be our neighbors in the future.
And what happened?
Rockets will, no doubt, again be launched against us.
The West has dominated the world ever since the industrial revolution.
Indeed, Confucianism became the official ideology of the Chinese state two centuries before the birth of Christ.
Possessing the people will give him the territory.
Virtue is the root; wealth is the result.
Many Confucian emperors were brutal.
Yet stability was achieved.
There was only one change of dynasty in China between 1368 and the end of the imperial era in 1911.
The Tokugawa Shoguns, who completed the reunification of Japan in 1600, remained in power for more than two and a half centuries.
In Korea, the Yi dynasty ruled from 1382 until the Japanese conquest of 1910.
The 1980s were hardly better.
I half-agree with this view.
There is, however, another way of looking at the Argentine tragedy.
Because the dynamics of Argentine debt were so unstable, a hard-currency exchange-rate peg could not last.
I half-agree with this view, too.
Nepal\u0027s Remarkable Peace
And how can hundreds of isolated settlements spread amidst a hostile Palestinian population ever be considered a strategic asset?
Netanyahu should, perhaps, have studied the lessons of the 1973 Yom Kippur war on the Golan Heights before denouncing Obama’s idea.
The legendary General Moshe Dayan, who was born in a socialist Kibbutz on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, was no less a skeptic about the chances of coexisting with the Arabs.
Eventually, he became the architect of a historic peace with Egypt.
On the contrary, he understood their “burning hatred.”
This is the wrong approach.
Literally, of course, he is not.
Indeed, while settlement-building in the West Bank has slackened, it continues.
By using the Palestinians’ own strategy, he has cornered them.
Netanyahu’s Useless Demand
I believe that some of the preconditions posed by the Israeli prime minister in his recent, widely reported speech are fully justified.
One look at a map is enough to understand this.
Other great and independent countries, such as Japan, Germany, and Austria, have been subjected for decades to limitations on their acquisition of certain weapons and military equipment.
With the advent of peace, we all hope that this bond will become consolidated around a common Israeli citizenship.
Networks come in many shapes and sizes.
Some create strong ties, while others produce weak ties.
They are also�the basis of democratic leadership.
The greatest democratic politicians have a large capacity for shallow friendships.
Governments have traditionally been very hierarchical, but the information revolution is affecting the structure of organizations.
Hierarchies are becoming flatter and embedded in fluid networks of contacts.
In business, too, networks are becoming more important.
Traditional business leadership styles have become less effective.
One management expert summarizes recent studies as describing an increase in the use of more participative processes.
Never Again to Genocide Trials
Better not.
This was not just any acquittal.
A&nbsp;genocidaire&nbsp;must intend both to commit a defined crime and to destroy the victim’s group.
In domestic law, the motive behind a crime is usually irrelevant – and for good reason.
The problem extends beyond Bosnia.
Any group whose suffering is not called “genocide” feels like a second-class victim.
Yet this is precisely what elevating genocide presupposes.
But it is not.
So let us end genocide as we know it – by stopping genocides, but also by abandoning the crime of genocide.
That is quite an accomplishment.
The reason?
The same holds true for China.
The Chinese people are educated and talented, and their country has great potential, with high economic growth rates and an industrious work force.
Last year, a US Department of Defense report noted that China’s defense expenditures appear to be much higher than acknowledged by the Chinese government.
Perhaps those in the West should listen more to their new partners.
New Directions for the UN
NEW YORK – The United Nations today leads what seems at times like a double life.
The problems are too complicated.
But the G-20, by itself, is not the answer.
And that is the way it should be.
“Present at the Creation,” he called his memoir.
We, too, are present at a new creation.
These are testing times for everyone.
People everywhere live in growing anxiety and fear.
Next week someone will start a website for Persian cats.
Each expects a 20% market share. Do the math: it won’t work.
People who know how to run a business.
Beware those who say starting an internet business is easy.
My first investment was with a guy I knew from Hungary who was going to create a joint venture to bring CompuServe into Hungary.
The guy was not the best guy in the world, but CompuServe had a good brand name.
Like the road network, the internet is an integrated channel, but one for communication.
It supports not just people and PC’s, but television broadcasts and radio; it supports many different formats.
Within a few years there will be more devices connected to the internet than people.
Now, we are connecting this virtual network to the real world.
Your luggage is going to have a little tag so you know where the airline sent it, which is different from where the airline sent you.
Established companies crumbled.
But you cannot have an internet economy without an internet society.
It means the end of the ‘official story.’
Established companies, established ways of doing business, established pricing structures, established channels of distribution are all under threat.
Most do not have the financial clout to counter the extraordinary pressures from financial markets.
Yet more resources and new instruments will be needed.
New Europe’s Old Problems
So much for the region’s “big four” countries.
Estonia and Lithuania applied as well, but were refused entry.
There has been no general tilt to the right or left in the region.
For now, the tension has been left unresolved, leading to high budget deficits. 
They could well squander the significant transfers that they receive through the agricultural and structural funds, as many previous EU recipients did.
Western Europe went through a similar phase of economic development in the 1950’s and 1960’s; now it is Central and Eastern Europe’s turn.
And then nothing.
None of them did, yet they raised themselves out of the crisis.
All the countries in crisis cut their public administration and wages.
Extremists on neither the right nor the left have benefited.
The new Czech foreign minister, Karel Schwarzenberg, stated: “We won by telling the truth.
Populism is no longer popular.”
Most remarkable was the victory of Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis on October 2.
Only Hungary has a large public debt.
Then, as developed-country governments imposed strict fiscal austerity in the wake of the global economic crisis, ODA fell again, to 0.31% of GDP in 2010-2011.
Some initiatives are already underway.
Furthermore, some proposals entail no additional funds.
Such emissions can be eliminated by either shifting to renewable forms of energy or reducing the emissions from fossil fuels.
New Model China
China's leaders are gathered for their annual retreat at the seaside resort of Beidaihe.
Call the new China "Chung-hua, Inc." ( Chunghua translates as "China" and actually means "the prosperous center of the universe.")
The first are relatively small, composed of cities and their surrounding areas, generally with a population of 5-7 million people.
The mega-regions, which tend to share common dialects, ethnic identities, and histories, are becoming economic powerhouses in their own right.
Regional governments have also been toughened up by the Chung-hua , Inc. ethic.
In January 2001, Bo Xhi Lai, then mayor of Dalian, was promoted to governor of Liaoning province.
The distribution of income is another important issue.
During the crisis, we saw how quickly capital fled from countries previously considered safe bets.
But more is needed, and the Fund is exploring cooperation with regional financing mechanisms, as well as new ways to use its instruments in a systemic crisis.
New Rules for Finance At Last
On April 2, France and Europe will be present.
New Rules for the Global Economy
CAMBRIDGE – Suppose that the world’s leading policymakers were to meet again in Bretton Woods, New Hamp­shire, to design a new global economic order.
1. Markets must be deeply embedded in systems of governance.
The United States, Europe, and Japan have produced comparable amounts of wealth over the long term.
One such impli­cation is the right of individual countries to safeguard their domestic institutional choices.
When states are not democratic, this scaffolding col­lapses.
These are the principles that the architects of the next global economic order must accept.
Instead, Hong Kong mostly vanished from the world's news radar after 1997.
To maintain political stability, both the Chinese and Hong Kong governments willingly shelved the issue during Tung's first term.
Hong Kong's people have spoken.
A shortsighted decision on the part of the Tung government will have serious negative repercussions not only in Hong Kong, but for Taiwan and around the world.
Micro, Macro, Meso, and Meta Economics
Doing so provides a natural linkage between micro and macro, because the micro-level rules and institutions typically imply macro-level consequences.
Similarly, Eric Beinhocker, at the newly established Institute for New Economic Thinking, argues for “a new way of seeing and understanding the economic world.”
Such migration is easier in the US than within the euro-zone or even within European countries.
The report, Child Well-Being in Rich Countries, takes a holistic view of the conditions of children in the United States, Canada, and Europe – 29 countries in all.
The Netherlands heads the list, followed by Norway, Iceland, Finland, Sweden, and Germany.
There are around 35 births for every 1,000 girls aged 15-19, compared to fewer than ten per thousand in the northern European countries.
Homicide rates in the US are roughly five times higher than in northern Europe.
This means asking a person directly about his or her life satisfaction.
In the Netherlands, a remarkable 95% of children set their rating at six or higher.
In the US, the proportion is much lower, at around 84%.
New Wave Nationalism
To follow the Olympic Games or the World Cup, the world had to learn to recognize new flags and new national anthems.
In January, a referendum on independence is scheduled to be held in South Sudan.
Somalia, Côte d’Ivoire, and even Nigeria may also give birth to new states.
The brutal behavior of the Sudanese regime based in Khartoum has made the country’s evolution towards partition both inevitable and legitimate.
This trend towards identity fragmentation is not only an African phenomoenon.
The economic crisis affects all parts of Spain.
Why should they work for “them”?
In Europe today, if there is violence, it is only economic in nature.
Of course, one can dream, as some once did, of a “Europe of Regions” based on the model of the city-states of Renaissance Italy.
The American sociologist Daniel Bell once famously said that the state is too big for the small problems and too small for the big ones.
New World, Less Order
Ultimately, the end of the Cold War came because of the revolution underway in the Soviet Union.
But these earlier reforms were in fact more difficult to undertake than the ones that I launched in the 1980's and 1990's.
This was no US-led conspiracy, but the collapse of the Soviet Union was convenient for America.
The US conceived of itself as the Cold War's winner, and winners, it seems, make the rules.
New Year, Same Crisis
I describe it in detail in my new book Financial Turmoil in Europe and the United States.
My proposal fulfills both the letter and the spirit of Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty.
For Europe and the United States, 2010 was a year of disappointment.
The question is, how do we get these resources back to work?
It will eventually happen.
So he has no right to claim, as he has, “a stunning victory” in “an epic intellectual debate.”
My preferred solution would be accountability.
As a Supreme Court justice, of course, Holmes opposed antitrust regulations.
But it is not crucial.
France has chosen – and it has chosen decisively.
That day will come, but its arrival will require more time.
The fifth lesson may be the most serious.
The French left, represented by the Socialists, has suffered its third consecutive defeat in a presidential election.
This lesson is so evident that the French Socialist Party now faces a clear choice.
You would think that France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the IMF would be more aware of recent history.
It was President Obasanjo, who as head of the military in the late 1970s, successfully led an earlier transition to democracy.
But the challenges facing the new state are awesome.
And because oil constitutes more than 90% of the country's exports, oil income is all that Nigerians have to live on in the world economy.
History could now repeat itself.
Three months later, the Army staged a coup--Nigeria's fifth since independence in 1960.
No leader can be expected to run this giant of Africa as if it were Singapore.
Legislative elections will be held on April 12th, followed by the presidential election a week later.
This is not to say that parochial sentiments are unimportant.
Nigeria’s Lost Chance
And, given its past performance, it is unlikely that the PDP will allow for a new and cleaner vote.
So once again, democracy in Nigeria is at a knife’s edge.
Armed militias in the Niger Delta are becoming bolder.
Russia is not alone in seeing oil as a means to transform its global standing.
The interests of the West and Nigeria repeatedly clashed, but Nigeria always stood its ground.
Nigeria’s Road to Ruin
With so much political friction in Iran and Iraq, it is easy to overlook the growing unrest in Nigeria, the world’s eighth-largest oil exporter.
To that end, he has marginalized many of his political rivals.
The deal did not last long.
Nigeria’s Sick Man Democracy
Nigerian Democracy Grows Up
Buhari is also the party’s presidential candidate.
The CPC won the majority of the seats in Katsina, but the PDP still managed to maintain its dominance of that volatile region’s politics.
To President Jonathan’s credit, he delivered clean elections.
Opposition parties found their feet, and the PDP’s power monopoly was finally broken – but not obliterated.
In fact, Jonathan and the PDP look set to turn in a good performance in the presidential polls.
But the long-term outcome of America’s rapprochement with China became visible only recently, with the economic integration of the People’s Republic into the world economy.
Deng Xiaoping’s reform and opening of China to the world would have been far more difficult. amp#160;
But China has no specialized agency in charge of international development assistance.
A third example is the absence of independent policy-research organizations.
Until now, China has not paid dearly for this.
Its role in the global economy is confined to low-to-medium-end processing and assembly functions.
Today, it is not only the superpowers who are capable of blackmailing the world with "super-murder."
Tourists are going into space!
Those interests are crystal clear.
The door to partnership is open; Russia need not break it down.
They understand that the issue is not just black and white.
No, You Can’t
On a per capita basis, the figure is roughly what it was 40 years ago: 70 million BTUs.
The underlying principle is a decidedly counterintuitive fact of life.
This is not an argument that should encourage anyone to go out and buy a Hummer.
Paulson had gotten a blank cheque from Congress once before. That was to deal with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
No Clash of Civilizations
No Country for Young Oligarchs
His articulate speech and self-made success are unusual among Russian politicians.
He hoped to break up Putin’s monopoly by using its own tools.
No Development, No Peace
The Middle East is a potentially lucrative nearby market.
The only way to sustainable peace is through sustainable development.
No Diseases for Old Men
The mean age of these patients was 85.
Canada’s taxpayers are not required to support the religious beliefs held by their fellow-citizens.
No Licenses to Kill
Nothing like this had happened since the Great Depression of the 1930’s.
We now know that they are not.
Three principles should guide reform.
Second, controlling asset bubbles requires control not only of the money supply, but also of the availability of credit.
The Internet bubble was unusual in this regard.
People buy CDS contracts not because they expect a default, but because they expect the CDS to appreciate in response to adverse developments.
It is the job of regulators to ensure that no one is ever granted such a license.
No Nukes?
The concern was understandable: radiation is very frightening.
Then there is the question of maintaining existing plants.
No Pause, Please
When the Fed kept interest at unusually low levels for an extended period of time, so did the ECB.
No Safe Havens for Dirty Money
Corruption – under any form or circumstance – is a cancer that cripples developed and developing economies alike.
No Smile Limit
It leaves the details to the locals, but offers organizational advice, loans out barbecues and sun umbrellas, and covers the public liability insurance.
Many people who have lived in the same street for many years meet each other for the first time at a street party.
Port Phillip is serious about being a good global citizen.
To protect that quality of life, it has to be able to measure all the varied aspects that contribute to it – and friendliness is one of them.
Very small positive experiences can make people not only feel better about themselves, but also be more helpful to others.
Here is one measure of success: over the past year and a half, the proportion of people who smile at you in Port Phillip has risen, from 8% to 10%.
No Time for a Trade War
NEW YORK – The battle with the United States over China’s exchange rate continues.
When the Great Recession began, many worried that protectionism would rear its ugly head.
Although US politicians focus on the bilateral trade deficit with China – which is persistently large – what matters is the multilateral balance.
No one wins from a trade war.
This has brought the region much needed stability.
That is why it has become so difficult for small and medium-sized companies to get new loans or to refinance existing loans.
We work with the private sector and not in competition with it.
The current economic situation has pushed the EBRD to its limits.
Neither has Europe.
But some vulnerable countries are still struggling to finance countercyclical investment and expanded social protection services.
Lastly, the G-20 could also help drive momentum on climate change.
BORDEAUX – Climatology and its emphasis on global warming is a comparatively recent addition to science.
At the twentieth century’s start, only one person in ten lived in a town or city.
But it is important not to stop there.
In 1795, however, liberal republics were abstract ideas.
Scholars have demonstrated the truth of this.
What he meant was that the mass murder of Cambodians was not deplorable in the same way as the mass murder of Europeans is.
When it comes to human rights, says Mr. Lee, there are no special Asian values.
During the Bengal famine of 1943, two to three million people died from hunger.
That happened under British rule.
That’s ten times the number of Indians who died in the gigantic starvation of British India less than twenty years before.
Now we recognize that there are no limits.
No War of Civilizations
But it was a mistake for the Norwegian Nobel Committee to cite his work in Aceh as a reason for giving him the prize.
The committee members increasingly seem to be prisoners of the past.
But that era is over.
Increasingly, the rest of the world has gone from being objects of world history to becoming its subjects.
Few believe that Muslims are capable of solving their political problems by themselves.
OSAKA – Japan is now confronting challenges at home and abroad that are as serious as any it has had to face since World War II’s end.
Though he has not specified exactly when he will do so, the endgame for the DPJ government has begun.
Some argue that little has changed as a result of the test.
The test made explicit what was implicit.
But what was assumed is now known.
So much has changed.
The stakes could hardly be higher.
North Korea is now the ninth state with nuclear weapons, joining the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Israel, India, and Pakistan.
The danger is that we may fast be approaching a tipping point.
North Korea’s Powerful Weakness
The subject was not new, but the tone was.
Torn between its two objectives, China placed a higher priority on preserving the Kim family dynasty.
What comes next is uncertain.
But cold realities do not necessarily have to turn into hot combat.
During the same period, there have been 10 South Korean presidents and 11 US presidents.
There is no quick fix in disentangling the Korean knot.
Not Only The Dutch Were Disgraced at Srebrenica
But the resignation of the Kok government does not deal with the disgrace of Srebrenica.
Then the Dutch peacekeepers were sent on their way, as were women and children.
Another 10,000 missing were later added to this remit from Kosovo.
The government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) could seize and extradite them - if it wished to.
Until now it has not.
The FRY wants to integrate with the Euro-Atlantic community.
Membership in the international community cannot be given away at a discount.
They are right.
True, the disappearance of growth is abrupt and more drastic than a soft landing; the carnage in high tech is pretty awful. For a moment there was real fear of a real recession.
Downward adjustments in profit expectations for corporations and hence for stocks may not reverse quickly; consumer confidence may decline another notch.
But imagine this is all wrong and a collapse does occur?
Bubbles in the Broth
Now, A World in Recession
But this year is different.
The 64th opening of the General Assembly asks us to rise to an exceptional moment.
And that is what we are doing, as action on three issues of historic consequence demonstrates.
Last week, 101 leaders from 163 countries met to chart the next steps toward December’s all-important UN climate change conference in Copenhagen.
Today, we have entered a new phase.
We need a breakthrough in this make-or-break year.
The world is united on a third front, as well.
But as nations united, the United Nations can.
Now or Never in Cyprus
Regrettably, the Greek Cypriot leadership at that time actively campaigned against the UN plan.
Today, many people might think that all of this is water under the bridge.
The talks between Turkish Cypriot President Mehmet Ali Talat and Greek Cypriot President Dimitris Christofias are now entering a critical phase.
Most Bulgarian rage is targeted at Europe.
This revival holds important implications for nuclear proliferation.
Another case in point is the Middle East.
One-by-one, the choices they make today will create a legacy -- deadly or peaceful -- for the future.
It is the region’s largest nuclear plant and sole producer of atomic weapons materials.
Since it went into operation in the mid-1960’s, it has generated elements for an estimated 200 nuclear weapons.
But it would not obstruct serious health consequences from other radioactive elements.
So, if Israel cannot guarantee the plant’s defense against attack, it should close it.
Mixed results followed.
No retaliation followed.
Nuremberg Judgments in Baghdad
When American troops were captured in Iraq, President Bush said that he expects them to be treated humanely.
The American military takes the Geneva Conventions seriously.
This is no way to set an example for the humane treatment of captured combatants.
Having said that, whatever America does at Guantanamo does not justify Iraqi mistreatment of American or British prisoners.
If the US continues to do all that it can to minimize civilian casualties, it has nothing to fear from an international tribunal.
The matter was made worse by the fact that one-click shopping seemed to be an "obvious" idea that shouldn't have been granted a patent in the first place.
Obama Across the Pacific
Only by resolving the structural issue will Asia succeed in overcoming the philosophical problem.
The philosophical problem concerns China’s renewed conception of itself as the “Middle Kingdom,” a state with no sovereign equal.
Obama and Global Warming
Sea levels are rising.
Coastlines are shrinking.
We’ve seen record drought, spreading famine, and storms that are growing stronger with each passing hurricane season.”
Sea levels are rising, but they have been rising at least since the early 1800’s.
Finally, it is simply wrong to say that storms are growing stronger every hurricane season.
This impression is no accident.
Senator Obama voted for the deal, as did Senator Joe Biden, one of its champions as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The flaw consists partly in viewing China, India’s largest trading partner, as a threat.
It also should build a partnership for the elimination of nuclear weapons within a set time frame in which the US must take a leadership role.
All five failed.
This will not be easy.
Direct diplomatic and strategic engagement between the US and Iran at the highest levels is a proposition yet to be tested.
Obama and the Rise of the Rest
There was a brief period in the 1970’s when a similar transfer took place.
The presidential election was two months away.
Obama in Africa
BERKELEY – On July 10, one very important descendant of black Africa will make a triumphant return to the motherland.
But, in choosing restraint over intervention, he has disappointed ordinary Africans and international activists alike.
He invited Martin Luther King, Jr. to his inauguration, giving the Atlanta-based civil rights leader a global platform for the first time.
Malcolm X, the black nationalist leader, visited Ghana two years later, and again in 1964.
Those related to security in Afghanistan and Pakistan are as treacherous as they have ever been.
As India’s foreign minister at the time, I told him: “Why make the visit destinational?
US-India summits are particularly prone to this hubris: the Great Republic meets the World’s Largest Democracy.
Ours is an unstable neighborhood, one that America has entered without fully understanding the consequences – for India and for the neighborhood.
What can the two countries do, separately and together?
Only through such acceptance can the two countries chart a common future.
But, at such moments, Obama might do well to recall Vajpayee’s words during Clinton’s visit, when he quoted Walt Whitman’s poem “Passage to India”:  
“Sail forth – steer for the deep waters only,
Cooperation with others will be essential.
In second place must be America’s two current wars.
The third priority will be what Bush misleadingly called a “global war on terrorism.”
The paradox of American power is that the strongest country since the days of Rome cannot achieve its objectives acting alone.
CAMBRIDGE – The United States is a nation of immigrants.
Chinese were singled out for exclusion from 1882 onward, and, with the more restrictive Immigration Act of 1924, immigration in general slowed for the next four decades.
During the twentieth century, the US recorded its highest percentage of foreign-born residents, 14.7%, in 1910.
A century later, according to the 2010 census, 13% of the American population is foreign born.
In contrast, the Census Bureau projects that the US population will grow by 49% over the next four decades.
Immigrants or children of immigrants founded roughly 40% of the 2010 Fortune 500 companies.
Equally important are immigration’s benefits for America’s soft power.
That is a view that Americans should take to heart.
Obama of Arabia?
From the Maghreb to the Levant to the Arabian Peninsula, Arab history is on the move.
This is one of those times.
What would that look like?
Six aircraft carriers, with their accompanying support vessels – indeed, 60% of America’s entire navy – are now stationed in the Pacific.
In addition, Obama’s administration has been conducting talks with the Philippines to increase and enhance naval cooperation.
Australia has established a base for marines in Darwin and another for unmanned spy planes on the Cocos Islands.
Afterwards, he went to Vietnam, allegedly for discussions about the US Navy’s use of Cam Ranh Bay, a major American base during the Vietnam War.
But few in the Western Pacific see it that way.
The Obama administration may believe that toughness directed at China will generate electoral support in the US.
The current Australian government would not take such a step, and the opposition would be unlikely to do so as well.
The Chinese understand the game being played.
I suspect that they will remain on the sidelines during the US election campaign.
On this front, however, China’s leaders made no compromise with Obama.
Voters want less spending, not higher taxes.
The US deficit for 2010 is roughly $1.3 trillion.
United Nations Resolution 181 in 1947 has already recognized Israel as a Jewish state.
The biggest impact that Obama can make, however, is beyond America’s borders.
The structure of the Security Council is 60 years old.
But this has not yet happened.
Obama’s Middle East Malady
Obama often has a plan A, but never a plan B. When it comes to conducting a successful foreign policy, plan A is never enough.
Obama’s Middle East
And you can add to this a reorientation of America’s military effort to the war in Afghanistan.
These are all products of a deliberate policy.
First among equals, and the indispensable nation.
2010 will be a critical year.
In May, 189 member states of the NPT will meet in Vienna to review its status.
Overall, the treaty has been a success.
Obama’s Pacific Pivot
The rest of the region stands to gain, too.
The Nuclear Security Summit plays an essential role in linking both strands of Obama’s nuclear policies.
A Man Without a Plan
But the electorate did not succumb to wishful thinking.
And yet US presidential campaigns generally neglect discussion of advisers or intellectual influences.
He was the NEC’s deputy director from its beginning in 1993 until 1996, and its director from 1996 to 2000.
Obama reappointed him as head of the NEC in January 2011.
His 2005 book The Pro-Growth Progressive contains many ideas about how to make the economy perform better.
None is grandiose, but together they might help substantially.
In fact, the reality could hardly be more different.
A turnaround needs to be visible to the naked eye to impress voters.
But smart power is by no means limited to the US.
After the Meiji Restoration of 1867-1868, a rising Japan built the military strength that enabled it to defeat Russia in 1905.
In 2007, President Hu Jintao proclaimed the importance of investing in China’s soft power.
In 2009, China was justly proud of its success in emerging from the global recession with a high rate of economic growth.
NEW HAVEN – There can be no military resolution to the war in Afghanistan, only a political one.
Writing that sentence almost makes me faint with boredom.
But historical documents recently made available reveal something much stranger.
That difference is important.
Urged by Senator Mike Mansfield to withdraw from Vietnam, he replied that he did not want another “China in Vietnam.”
Indeed, the military has in effect militarized the arguments of the peace movement of the 1960’s.
Does it know how to cut losses?
Or must it plunge over every cliff that it approaches?
Obama the Centrist
Obama has thus positioned himself to the right not only of Joseph Stiglitz, Simon Johnson, and Paul Krugman, but also of his advisers Paul Volcker and Larry Summers.
Obama the Statesman
The common thread in all of these achievements is old-fashioned diplomacy.
She has lived up to her reputation.
He leads from wherever he needs to lead in order to get results.
And he’s gotten plenty.
Think of Josephine Baker, who wowed Parisians and Berliners at a time when blacks could not vote – or even use the same bathrooms as whites – in many parts of the United States.
Cities like Paris, Copenhagen, and Amsterdam offered refuge to black American jazz musicians, who needed a break from institutionalized racism.
The same was true for other artists.
James Baldwin, for example, found a home in France.
This did not help him much at home.
In this, they have more or less followed public opinion.
Others expressed the same disillusion with a gloating air of schadenfreude .
This, too, is probably an illusion.
That is why they are going crazy over Barack Obama’s election.
Obesity Unbound
His administration regards this as part of a comprehensive approach to generating “good-paying American jobs.”
In fact, much economic research is devoted to understanding how government intervention can improve economic performance.
An apprentice economist no longer needs to be particularly bright to produce unorthodox policy conclusions.
It is as if introductory physics courses assumed a world without gravity, because everything becomes so much simpler that way.
Nor does it make them more popular.
The scale and structure of any out-of-court mortgage settlement should address the damage inflicted by the alleged pattern of behavior.
Policymakers can respond in three ways.
The European Union wants to establish a European Systemic Risk Board composed of the national central bank governors, chaired by the European Central Bank.
Of Saints and Servants
In the summer of 1998 they were re-buried with honour in Saint Petersburg.
This summer, the Russian Orthodox Church canonized our last Royal family as martyrs.
They had names and would never be asked to carry out dreadful or dangerous tasks.
The most ancient in our family was Nanny Grusha.
She was small and light, with white fluffy hair.
For me, that shade of brown remains the colour of safety.
There is no God!
Nanny loved my mother because my mother was once her baby.
She did it when Leningrad was dying of hunger, when dead bodies lay everywhere and people ate people.
But we should remember who, it is said, will pass through the eye of a needle to find salvation.
The United Kingdom has been reluctant to join the hydraulic-fracturing (or fracking) revolution.
Oil in the Gulf, Then and Now
VIENNA – On April 20, an explosion on Deepwater Horizon, a British Petroleum (BP)- operated oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, led to the most publicized oil spill in decades.
The platform where that accident happened, called Ixtoc 1, was operated by Pemex, the state-owned Mexican oil company.
Some part of it will float on the surface, but parts may also form plumes at different depths in the water mass.
The damage caused by the Ixtoc spill was huge.
Because of the dispersion, shrimp, squid, and some fish populations suffered, with fisheries hit even harder.
The high temperatures of the Gulf of Mexico helped, as recovery proceeds much faster in warm waters than in cold.
When the FIS seemed headed to victory, Algeria's army stepped in to prevent continuation of the vote.
American behavior in former Soviet Central Asia is equally vivid.
Can they deliver?
The global oil market has become a large sea that generates its own storms, which guarantee that the sea will continue to grow.
The global oil situation is particularly interesting at the moment.
If output grows above trend, the budget is in surplus; if it grows below trend, the budget is in deficit.
The oil fund accumulates surpluses and incurs deficits when the price of oil is above or below the average.
This is what Norway does.
Old and Aging Europe
Europe is indeed old, and growing older.
Across the continent children are increasingly scarce.
Spain is still a young society, but a society without children is doomed.
The fertility rate for the US, by contrast, is 2.4, and it is 2.1 for the UK.
Working hours in Europe as a whole fell from 1713 hours per year in 1980 to about 1576 today, with Germans putting in the least number of hours at work.
Gunther Grass famously titled one of his novels "Headbirths, or the Germans are Dying Out."
Little could he know how true his fantasy would just three decades later.
Old Europe, Young World
Old Left Versus New Left in Latin America
But there is another way of looking at these events.
The Right to Eat
But such efforts have had limited success.
The recent law is a milestone in this process, but by no means the end point.
In Nigeria, Argentina, and Nepal, the right to food has recently been invoked on behalf of regions and population groups – including indigenous peoples – whose access to food was threatened.
Humala is no novice politician rising to victory on charm and luck.
García recently signed an economic agreement with Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, called Pacto del Pacífico, which is destined to reorient Latin America’s economies.
Breaking with these strategic policies would harm Peru’s economy.
In fact, Brazil’s leaders have good reason to be flexible: their country needs the access to the Pacific that Peru and Chile offer.
Half of Peru’s citizens did not side with him.
So, what is the secret of Olympic success?
Past performance is also important: the visibility and prestige of a sport increases after Olympic success, as does funding.
Over the past ten Olympics, the host country has won 54% more medals on average than when it was not the host.
Some sports are more sensitive to income and host-nation effects than others.
Some of the sports at which Britain has done particularly well, like cycling and rowing, are most highly influenced by income and host effects.
The answer to the first is not obvious.
When all is said and done, sports is entertainment; the others are necessities.
One can treat this claim with a certain degree of skepticism – after all, the 2004 Athens Olympics failed to produce a Greek economic miracle.
Nothing is more discredited in Anglo-American economics than the policy of “picking winners.”
Olympic Gamesmanship
Several prominent American politicians have voiced support for a boycott.
Some perspective is called for.
There are also indications that China’s foreign policy is evolving.
But reality is not one-dimensional.
All of which brings us back to this summer’s events in Beijing.
PARIS – Is there a link between economic power and Olympic medals?
In 1992, immediately after the Cold War’s end, the United States and the former Soviet Union’s “Unified Team” won a quarter of the medals in Barcelona.
Countries with great demographic potential therefore inherently have great Olympic potential.
Conversely, Australia appears to be the only country with less than 50 million inhabitants gaining more than 3% of the medals at a Summer Olympic Games.
Overall, it is fair to say that South America and the Middle East remain fringe players at the Olympics.
The Caribbean, for example, far outranks Brazil.
National traditions are the second important factor in Olympic success.
Ethiopians begin running in childhood as a means to reach, say, a distant school in the highlands.
And the Caribbean does not necessarily offer many sports activities besides track and field, for which relatively few material resources are needed to create champions.
But traditions can also be created.
Such policies embody a country’s choice in developing one or several sports.
Runners can travel and train individually on the best tracks.
Obviously, however, development does play a significant role.
There are no less-developed countries, with the possible exception of Ukraine, in the top 15.
Africa received only 3% of all medals in London.
Everyone tries to ignore it; that is, when they are not laughing at it.
In Poland, a ``joke'' party of malignant intentions is emerging.
For this reason, I cannot laugh at him.
They want to gut state power so that jackals like themselves can feed on the corpse.
Not for long.
He is not a nationalist like France's Le Pen; he is neither rightist nor leftist.
You smuggled and you became relatively rich.
You cannot win domestic wars (even non-violent ones) through legal processes alone.
When democracy is at stake you must defend it, to borrow a line from Malcolm X, ``by any means necessary.''
Over the last year or two, however, the pace of integration into the People's Republic of China has quickened decisively.
I only became uneasy when the British editor (Jonathan Fenby) was fired and replaced.
"They still let me write what I want..."
Management talked of the virtues of writing to allow readers to read between the lines.
Now Hong Kong itself is undoing the system.
One Big Union
Many individual countries have taken a generation to develop their own domestic schemes.
How could a eurozone supervisor be based outside the eurozone?
The second unresolved question is how to achieve a banking union in legal terms.
But that is not the case for the United Kingdom, and London remains the continent’s biggest financial center, by far.
And Euroskeptic British politicians see this as an opportunity to recast the UK’s relationship with the EU; indeed, for some, it means a chance to negotiate an exit.
There needs to be a strategy, priorities must be weighed, and empirical evidence analyzed.
But the answer is not to let a collapse in the world’s car industry fuel a deeper recession.
Any crisis is also an opportunity.
One Europe
"One Europe" will be the rallying-call of the Danish Presidency of the EU, which begins this week.
One Europe in pursuit of freedom, security and justice.
The bloodiest century in European history started in August 1914.
We can end it in December 2002.
1945 brought peace and freedom - but only to some of us.
Enlargement is the geo-strategic choice of a generation.
It is about uniting a continent.
This year provides a historic window of opportunity.
We must seize it.
But some candidates will not be able to conclude negotiations this year.
The door remains open to the countries of the Balkans too.
Our guiding principle always remaining: One Europe.
To this end, we must strengthen the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
As is well known, this will happen in close cooperation with Greece.
One Forest, Two Tigers
The reaction by China’s public to the gory photos of the injured was furious.
In Japan, such skits are apparently regarded as humorous; in China, the skit was seen as lewd and insulting.
Even though the Japanese students apologized, they were expelled.
Kill!
Sino-Japanese amity was hardly enhanced in mid-November, when a Chinese nuclear sub encroached into Japanese waters.
Why has this popular nationalism emerged?
And why is it directed at Japan?
Recent developments suggest that a purely cooperative bilateral relationship is unlikely, to say the least.
First, the US and global economies remain mired in recession.
One Number Says it All
NEW HAVEN – The number is 0.2%.
Never before in the post-World War II era have American consumers been so weak for so long.
These figures are a good deal weaker than originally stated.
This is, by far, one of the most significant I have ever seen.
The heavy artillery of monetary and fiscal stimulus is being wasted on attempts to short-circuit balance-sheet repair.
One World, One Europe
They are probably are even less willing to do so today in the name of a Union that is less popular than ever, at least in the British Isles.
They should make of necessity an opportunity.
Such a move would be deemed premature by numerous critics.
Even Switzerland is intervening to weaken the franc.
Opening China, Then and Now
The US still recognized Taiwan, under the name of The Republic of China, as the legitimate and sole government of China.
(Today, it is a staggering $387 billion.)
(Mao had died in 1976).
Opening Up Japan
That things have turned out far differently reflects Japan's inertia.
The problems underlying Japan's decline are legion.
Too many industrial dinosaurs are kept on life support.
So, although some firms do extremely well - say, Toyota and Canon - there is little space for new ventures and entrepreneurs.
In Asia, Japan ranks above only North Korea in scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) examination.
What should Japan do?
The only solution for Japan is to open up - not only its economy, but its society, its universities, its media, its think tanks, and, indeed, its bars and bathhouses.
It has been 150 years since the "black ships" of America's Navy forcibly opened up Japan.
Today, the Japanese must open up their country themselves.
PRINCETON – In Riyadh last March, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia decorated American Vice President Dick Cheney with the Kingdom’s Order of Merit.
Here are a few lines of the kind of poetry that Al Qaeda uses:
            and to live a life of comfort and happiness,
            is gored with a poisoned knife;
the establishment of “security” while chaining my wrists.
Moreover, Al Qaeda uses poetry to address the challenges that it faces.
Contrasting its fighters’ bravery and commitment with the “comfort” of Muslim bystanders, Al Qaeda tries to rally more fighters to its cause in Iraq.
Its dilemma is stark.
With bin Laden’s death, Al Qaeda is likely to wither away as an organization.
For the US, Pakistan poses a particularly difficult challenge.
Make no mistake: the scourge of Pakistani terrorism emanates more from the country’s Scotch whisky-sipping generals than from the bead-rubbing mullahs.
That effect, however, has to come on top of withdrawing the current fiscal stimulus that all countries have implemented.
And that is just a start.
That mechanism is broken beyond repair.
The NICE era is well and truly over.
Welcome to the BAD (Big Annual Deficits) decade of public debt.
Our Double-Dip Future
Despite this, artificial life-support has worked.
Others – including me – failed to anticipate the extent of the rebound.
Humpty Dumpty cannot be put together again.
But the source of the authority is always the sovereign state.
So regulations must become international in scope.
Otherwise, global financial markets will be destroyed by regulatory arbitrage.
It will be difficult to get countries to agree on uniform regulations.
Different countries have different interests, which drive them towards different solutions.
Our Energy Future
Instead, world oil prices have soared to $35 per barrel.
We should aim to develop technologies and infrastructure so that these other fossil fuels can be used efficiently and safely.
Chemical processes already exist, for example, to convert coal into gasoline.
This process, called "carbon capture and disposal," is being pursued by some of the world's leading engineers.
Our G-Zero World
A G-Zero world without leadership and multilateral cooperation is an unstable equilibrium for global economic prosperity and security.
One US television station even apologized to a Dutch reporter in the name of the American people.
As the Post pointed out, there is no such thing as involuntary euthanasia in the Netherlands.
Probably not.
That is why people read Le Monde, The New York Times, or, indeed, the Washington Post.
That has changed.
Everything is political.
That is the only truth that counts.
But, as so often happens, ideas have a way of migrating in unexpected ways.
It has been more than 30 million years since the earth’s temperature was that high.
If we fail on one, we will fail on the other.
But conditions in the drug market are far from optimal.
Direct but shadowy information tends to lead to “disease mongering” – the creation of diseases in order to boost prescriptions.
Our Summer of Extremes
BERLIN – This summer has been one of weather-related extremes in Russia, Pakistan, China, Europe, the Arctic – you name it.
For weeks, central Russia has been in the grips of its worst-ever heat wave, which has caused probably thousands of fatalities.
Are these events connected?
But that is extremely unlikely.
All weather is driven by energy, and the sun ultimately provides this energy.
For each degree Celsius of warming, 7% more water is available to rain down from saturated air masses.
Clinging to the hope that it is all chance, and all natural, seems naive.
There were 74 independent countries in the world in 1945; today there are 193.
This made sense in 1945; it does not today.
Why France and Britain and not Germany or Japan, two much larger economies?
Or India and Brazil, two huge countries?
True, France and Britain do have the best foreign services in Europe, but this is reversing cause and effect.
France and Britain maintain this capability because they continue to have foreign-policy relevance.
Nevertheless Germany, France, Italy, and Britain hold four of the seven seats at the G7 meetings.
Shouldn't there be only one seat for Europe?
Europe is being myopic.
Our Virtual Middle Ages
Wikipedia , the online encyclopedia, is the most impressive collective intellectual project ever attempted – and perhaps achieved.
Wikipedia is an encyclopedia to which anyone with a modicum of time, articulateness, and computer skills can contribute.
Wikipedia’s boosters trumpet it as heralding the arrival of “Web 2.0.”
Indeed, a much smaller, slower, and more fragmented version of the Wikipedia community came into existence with the rise of universities in twelfth- and thirteenth-century Europe.
In the Middle Ages, this attitude spawned scholastic disputation.
BLOOMINGTON, INDIANA – Winston Churchill once said that, in wartime, truth was so precious that it needed to be surrounded by a “bodyguard of lies.”
What McCain was referring to was a peaceable presence of US forces in the country for a long period, rather like their continued presence in Japan since 1945. 
While most Iraqis understand the need for US forces to be in their country for the short term, they will not abide a permanent deployment.
Iraqi politicians have not been exempt from posturing for political gain.
Out of Step at the ECB
The United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom all have cut interest rates recently.
Who are they kidding?
The hawks were right to be in a hurry.
Not a chance.
Being out of step has consequences.
When the Canadian dollar sharply appreciated, the Bank of Canada did more than talk – it cut interest rates.
* Croatia is demonstrating that deinstitutionalization is not a question of money.
It is time for the rest of Central and Eastern Europe to catch up to Serbia.
Outsourced and Out of Work
The latest buzzword in the globalization debate is outsourcing.
Start with the following:
Overcoming Africa’s North-South Divide
Similarly, when Morocco quit the OAU in 1984, it dreamed of European Union membership.
Mauritania’s leaders quit ECOWAS, the West African regional grouping, to join the union formed by the North African countries.
Likewise, the other people of North African countries are Berbers who, less than half a century ago, were given cash incentives to learn Arabic.
The African Union needs thorough rethinking.
Time is of the essence.
We have given the Kyoto approach, based on emission rights, more than a fair chance.
At the very least, it is worth giving the alternative a chance.
The Eurozone’s Agenda in 2013
In this context, Van Rompuy’s report is crucial.
But Van Rompuy’s minimal proposal may be insufficient.
Test-Driving Driverless Cars
ANN ARBOR – It is June 15, 2030, and for Sam and Sue of Ann Arbor, Michigan, it is going to be a busy day.
Their daughter Sophia has a 9 a.m. karate match.
Sally, who must arrive at school by 10:30, has already ordered a Maghicle ride.
When she boards at 10:15, she receives a text message from her best friend Amanda, who wants to ride with her.
Now, because he does not need to own a car, he spends far less money on transportation and has more time to do as he pleases.
And, with more than 1.2 million people dying on the road each year, car travel remains a proven killer.
At the US median hourly wage of $25, each mile costs $0.83.
Once the prototypes have proved effective and practical, they should scale quickly without public incentives.
Pain without Purpose
The third moment is now.
1. Don’t go there in the first place.
Attempts to carry out one of the three may exclude or interfere with attempts to carry out the others.
But that is not our situation today.
But that, too, is not the situation today in the core economies of the North Atlantic.
We know the cures.
Now, however, the election will likely be postponed.
Karachi, a multi-ethnic metropolis, could erupt into full-scale chaos.
But this need not be a foregone conclusion.
First, it must establish an independent commission to determine who was responsible for Bhutto’s murder.
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto anointed his wife and daughter to be the PPP’s co-chairpersons in case he was executed by the military regime that had overthrown him.
Pakistan’s Black Revolution
They stood with and for their judges, making it virtually impossible for judges willing to take Musharraf’s oath of allegiance to operate.
As these islands begin to form an archipelago, a legal class emerges, supported by the clients who need them.
Pakistan’s Cruel Summer
It came from the military.
It will be lucky if it manages to achieve 2.8%, one half of that expected in Bangladesh and one-third of that projected for India.
Or will the country’s civilian leaders mend their ways?
To be sure, profound political and cultural distinctions exist between Iran in the 1970’s and contemporary Pakistan.
More importantly, Iran’s Shia clerics were both organized and politically active in a way that Pakistan’s Sunni clergy have not been.
An earlier meeting of the group was chaired by Obama on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session in New York last year.
This would facilitate western China’s access to the sea, via the Pakistani port of Gwadar.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the US wanted Pakistan to help end Taliban rule in Afghanistan.
More power needs to be devolved to the provinces.
But thousands of fighters are thought to be dispersed in the Pashtun tribal areas of Pakistan, with many of them focused on operations in Afghanistan.
Pakistan must be able to focus internally on its future.
Pakistan\u0027s War of All Against All
Interestingly, computer technology is exempted, as it can be used to further the extremist cause.
It remains to be seen, however, whether he will be progressive enough.
Pakistan’s War with Itself
They were not evacuated. They were left to walk for miles and days to safety.
So are Pakistan’s people.
This is not Pakistan.
Only occasionally was the fighting “officially” reported.
Access to the area was denied to independent media.
Who is providing the Taliban with guns and money?
And will army shelling really end the war?
Palestine after Abbas?
Moreover, Abbas has not given up his positions as head of the PLO and leader of its biggest faction, Fatah, which remains in control in the West Bank.
Palestine as a Failed State
Near Tel Aviv, in adjoining Jaffa, a competing militia under Hassan Salameh, took control.
The Palestinians confront a harsh reality.
And a Palestine divided against itself will never secure its independence.
NOT TO BE PUBLISHED BEFORE JANUARY 10
The Israeli-built wall to the west of the West Bank means that Palestinian unemployment will continue to rise and living standards will continue to drop.
The key to establishing civil order is peace.
In more recent history, since 1991’s Madrid Conference, direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians have taken place in various formats.
And, clearly, that change in tactics has hit a raw nerve with Israelis and frustrated the US.
Palestine’s War of Generations
A seamless transition appeared possible.
The Sixth Fatah Congress, the first in sixteen years, will take place in August 2005 and will seek to reconcile the conflict between the Old and Young Guard.
Whether he can be released from prison is now a source of intense speculation.
Hamas has declared that it will not nominate its own candidate for the PA presidency.
That answer will most likely determine who will be the PA’s next leader.
Palestine Stands Up
This may be a real game changer.
Palestinians identify strongly with the civil rights movement in the United States.
The depth of this compromise can be fully appreciated only in its historical context.
Of course, that is not how things have turned out: Palestinians have been living under Israeli occupation for 41 years.
Palestinian patience is not infinite.
Palestinian Refugees and German Expellees
The new situation in Iraq, along with the Middle East road map, were at the center of attention.
The German minister supplied the answer.
The Palestinians' demand for the right of return has an analogous meaning.
There is no other example of UN member countries going to war to prevent implementation of UN decisions.
STOCKHOLM: Olof Palme, Sweden's then Prime Minister, was assassinated 15 years ago on February 28th.
The crime was an attack not only on Palme, but on democracy itself.
The Vietnam War changed the world view of many young people.
Much the same happened when Palme visited Cuba.
He shared a podium with Fidel Castro at a mass rally in Santiago de Cuba.
For people seeking or defending democracy and human rights, Palme was an unreliable partner.
Until her promotion, no member of the G-7 had a woman heading its central bank.
Moreover, men occupy all 23 seats on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Governing Council.
Why were there no suitable female candidates in the first place?
On the contrary, female candidates tend simply to be overlooked.
If a lack of skills or experience is not preventing women from reaching the summit of monetary policymaking, what is?
Parents or Gods?
Ethicists have grappled with such scenarios, and many would find this clinical option to be ethically sound.
But what if the older sibling requires a donated kidney?
Parties and Populists
This is not a good time for political parties, especially those with traditional orientations.
Not infrequently they have to form a “grand coalition.”
The old proletariat and the old bourgeoisie are gone.
People are, in a sense, socially homeless.
This is the condition in which populists thrive.
Many other names could be added to the list.
Still, they do fulfill a useful function by bundling interests and issues, thereby providing an element of stability in the political system.
Those structures are gone forever, but a liberal-democratic order cannot succeed through situational politics built on popular resentments.
Partnerless in Pakistan
The PML-Q, created in 1999 by Pakistan’s intelligence agencies, is now political deadwood.
His party also wants the sacked Supreme Court justices to be restored.
But he and Sharif did agree “in principle” to form a government.
Partnership?
What Partnership?
London – European Union policy toward its neighbors to the east is in trouble, despite the launch of its new Eastern Partnership.
The idea for the “Eastern Partnership” (EaP) came from a Polish-Swedish initiative early last summer.
But the EU has its own problems with the initiative.
For example, it had a lot of trouble persuading leaders to turn up in Prague on Thursday.
In March 2009 Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev staged a constitutional referendum that opened the way for his lifetime presidency.
Most controversial of all has been “Europe’s last dictator,” Belarusan President Alyaksandr Lukashenka.
All six states, except Belarus, now trade more with the EU than with Russia.
Fake elections are rapidly become the norm.
Past-time for Pension Reform
More than half of Latin American firms consider poor infrastructure to be a major obstacle to the operation and growth of their business.
Laying kilometer upon kilometer of bitumen is the favored solution for many politicians.
But other options are more cost-effective.
As a result, less than 65% of agricultural products in Latin America reach markets.
Communication between users and government services is vital to achieve any real improvement.
Regions then can be turned into engines of growth.
Firms that go global are more likely to stick around, adding to the economy and employing locals.
Paying the Price of Reform
But is it?
More fundamentally, there is no such thing as a “European economy.”
The problem, though, is that some people have even become addicted; they now aim at living on welfare benefits alone.
Here is one idea.
The challenges facing Kim are piling up.
Peace, Not Process
The results are mixed, at best.
Peace Now for Palestine
The US needs to get out in front.
The US should not be selective in its support for freedom and democracy.
This crisis, like so many others, would be a terrible thing to waste.
Peace Now
The US embraced the Shah of Iran, and got the Iranian Revolution.
What unites us is vastly greater than what divides us.
The same is true with artists, musicians, sports teams, and community leaders.
Peace On All Fronts?
So is the Middle East at the gates of a lasting, comprehensive peace?
Not quite.
Tactical moves, however, can always develop into strategic shifts.
Peace or Poison
And yet there is something unique about the Holocaust that made the United Nations single it out and devote a special day to its commemoration.
Even less did the Nazis kill Jews because of their ideological differences – Jews had no peculiarly “Jewish” ideology.
Peace Process or Real Peace?
Former United States senator George Mitchell represents a relatively neutral third party supervising the current talks.
These “proximity talks” allow Mitchell to ensure that each side is making serious offers.
Direct talks also have some well-known liabilities.
He felt that the situation was not right for direct talks.
Peace Through Development
The Taliban are also extending their reach into neighboring Pakistan.
It is easy for the Taliban and al-Qaeda to mobilize fighters under such conditions.
Peace through Superior Football
The Israel-Palestine conflict has lasted far too long.
Where there is a will, there is a way.
Infrastructure investment would then follow. 
Let us imagine that they could then work hand in hand to host the biggest sporting event in the world.
People Power in the Caucasus
But, going back to the Russian, British, and Ottoman Empires that once battled here, they have been continually exploited by politicians and generals.
LONDON – Economics, it seems, has very little to tell us about the current economic crisis.
One of them is called “asymmetric information.”
But apply it to buyers and sellers.
Suppose the seller of a product knows more about its quality than the buyer does, or vice versa.
In 1970, George Akerlof published a famous paper called “The Market for Lemons.”
The buyer doesn’t know whether what is being offered is a good car or a “lemon.”
Because the owner won’t be able to get a good price for a good car, he won’t place good cars on the market.
Another well-known example concerns insurance.
Information is king.
So these models cannot explain a situation in which everyone, or almost everyone, is losing – or, for that matter, winning – at the same time.
Economics, in other words, must start from the premise of imperfect rather than perfect knowledge.
My trip took place in April 2002, a somewhat optimistic time.
In turn, the EU initiated an extensive humanitarian aid project.
Unfortunately, the agreement did not last long.
Is that possible?
This approach could be one way to stabilize the region during this period of heightened uncertainty.
Allying himself with the Bush administration has increased his unpopularity, especially following missile attacks by the United States in Pakistan’s tribal areas.
These include the Jaish-e-Muhammad, considered to be the pioneer of suicide bombings in the region.
The clerics openly defy the state.
Clerics realize that the government wants to play ball.
In a radio broadcast on April 12, the clerics issued a threat: “ There will be suicide blasts in the nook and cranny of the country.
We have weapons, grenades, and we are expert in manufacturing bombs.
We are not afraid of death…. ”
The government should abolish coeducation.
Quaid-e-Azam University has become a brothel.
I think I will have to send my daughters of Jamia Hafsa to these immoral women.
Our female students have not issued the threat of throwing acid on the uncovered faces of women.
There is no harm in it.
Pharmaceutical Myths
But the real story is very different.
In 2002, for example, the top ten American drug companies had sales of $217 billion.
Compare the 17% profit margin for the top ten American drug companies in 2002 with the median of only 3.1% for all of America’s “Fortune 500” industries that year.
Moreover, 68% were not even new chemical compounds, but just old drugs in new forms or combinations.
There are now whole families of me-too drugs, and little reason to think one is better than another at comparable doses.
Even among related me-too drugs, the original is usually based on government-sponsored work.
Most of today’s top-selling drugs have progenitors that date back to the 1980’s or even earlier.
Physics Confidential
Physicists are justly proud of the many ways that their achievements have benefited humankind.
But building a light bulb or a telephone doesn’t mean that you understand its basic principles (Thomas Edison and Alexander Bell certainly didn’t).
In fact, what is presented as a shimmering cathedral often more closely resembles a hastily erected shantytown.
If Newtonian mechanics is at the bottom of everything, then one should be able to derive the second law of thermodynamics from Newtonian physics.
Nowadays, with computers, we can approximate the trajectory as closely as we want.
Well, particles are exactly where Newton goes awry – and not just in first-semester physics.
Central to any quantum mechanics course is the concept of electron “spin,” but what, exactly, is spinning is never made clear.
On the other hand, if you view the electron as a point particle, how are you to imagine something without a radius spinning?
To cure the point-particle pathologies, physicists invented modern field theories, with impressive names such as quantum electrodynamics.
To start, Fox must listen more carefully than he has to the people he governs.
They don't want a job that will solve their problems for three years, but rather a precise path to residency in the US that will solve their problems forever.
For those who have worked in the US for 10 or 15 years, the Bush piñata is a mere decoration.
Bush's proposal is full of holes, and Fox should figure out how to fill them.
Since Bush's proposal doesn't incorporate Mexico's interests, Fox should spell them out.
If Bush's piñata can't spell out all the details, Fox should define them in Mexican and bilateral terms.
Pigs, Calves, and American Democracy
In Arizona, citizens can, by gathering a sufficient number of signatures, put a proposed law to a direct popular vote.
There is no federal legislation at all on the welfare of farm animals – and very little state legislation, either.
Or does the state take charge when the market fails to perform socially necessary functions – such as fighting wars or maintaining full employment?
Was this just a peculiarity of the eurozone, in which sovereign countries did not control their own currencies?
The European Central Bank is probably the most perfect expression of this philosophy.
Its independence was secured not only by national legislation within the member states, but also by a treaty between them.
Pinochet’s Trial, Chile’s Dignity
Other judges and official bodies need to keep the pressure on Pinochet.
Moreover, investigations by the US Congress into the Riggs Bank have uncovered the suspicious means by which Pinochet and his family obtained their wealth.
These investigations need to be followed up with judicial action.
Like an airplane piloted in confusion, the European economy has not behaved according to the instructions.
Six important issues speak to the problem for policymakers in Europe, the US, and Japan.
Finally, communication has been dreadful.
Playboy and the Mullah
Late this spring, something changed, and within a few weeks moderates made dramatic public advances.
Everybody knew that a goal scored by him was not a real goal.
What's true of children and adults is also true of international institutions.
Yet the invasion went ahead.
Playing Russian Roulette with Climate Change
The absence of a binding agreement could mean a global hangover, and not just for a day.
If this means a total reworking of the current document, so be it.
But the rich must move first.
Plugging the Leaks
The lack of equity resulted largely from the concept of “limited liability,” which provided an incentive for excessive leveraging.
That period is now over.
Europe Moves East
In the name of the defense of media freedom, they were denouncing a government that they found too “centrist” and insufficiently “Polish.”
Poland, which is not yet part of the eurozone, sees no alternative to the EU.
Poland’s only way is West – but the European West more than the American one.
The Spaniards are right.
And how can Europe move ahead with such vivid pecking orders?
Nearly everywhere, you can see tangible signs of the EU’s support: a bridge here, a school there.
Poland\u0027s Christian Mission in Europe
Western Europe is less and less the core of Christian civilization, and the most dynamic forms of Christianity today are less and less European.
Yet it is at this moment that Catholic Poland is ``rejoining Europe.''
All attempts by the communist regime to sever the links between the Catholic Church and the Polish nation failed.
One reason for this positive attitude may be connected with the apostolic assignment the Pope has reserved for the Polish Church.
What he discovered, however, was that Western material goods and values were flooding the East and polluting that reservoir.
Let Poland be Poland.
The Polish right was last in power in 1997, having previously governed in the years 1990-1993.
In 1998, however, prosperity vanished.
But the large swings in Polish politics are not merely the result of political shenanigans. They reflect the instincts of Polish voters.
Poverty is a personal flaw.
The excluded - as most sociological research shows - vote at about the same rate as other adults.
As their votes today are dispersed, they pose no immediate danger.
Ten years ago “Solidarity” represented an ideal “political community”.
Poland\u0027s Jacquerie
"Bless... the peasant who is born, eats, and dies without anyone bothering about his affairs."
So wrote that some-time Italian journalist best known for his musical compositions, Giuseppe Verdi.
In Poland, for example, peasants not only want to shout news of their affairs to the world, but they want to shape Poland in their own image.
Not here in Eastern Europe.
Poland's peasants, who gained a glimpse of the wider world since 1989, see what is going on and fear it.
Standstill.
There are few buyers because Polish land is too poor.
Verdi at least offered his peasants that illusion.
Polio\u0027s Defeat and Its Global Meaning
Last year, 480 children were paralyzed, in parts of 10 countries.
That's a 99.8% reduction, but it is still 480 children too many. 
Globally, investing in polio eradication helps everyone.
To protect every child, polio must be eradicated globally.
Without these funds, polio immunization activities will have to be postponed, cancelled or seriously cut back in several countries. 
We have invested much in this fight.
Political Evolution
It’s a new kind of relationship.
They will always be looking for a lighthouse, faros , as we say in Greek.
It is no longer just one side against the other.
Above all, to be “strong,” you’re supposed to be giving orders.
Power by itself has no principles.
Political Islam’s Loss of Democratic Legitimacy
They have allowed an enormous concentration of power in the hands of one person and the parliamentary majority that he leads.
Conditioning the Arab Transition
But there are many precedents, including the post-conflict packages agreed for Sudan, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
The new European Commission has been named.
What should be its primary goals?
In fact, his fight against state aid clashed with normal Italian practice.
The German government is also worried by the Commission's resolution to question the "Volkswagen law."
Moreover, a public company’s political spending decisions should not be solely the province of management, as they often are.
And these directors should provide an annual report explaining their choices during the preceding year.
In the United Kingdom, for example, public companies have been subject to such a requirement for more than a decade.
That is why we need new legislation to ensure that the use of corporate funds in politics does not stray from the interests of shareholders.  
Politics With a Human Face
At long last, Russia's ``third branch of government'' is becoming less Leninist and less corrupt.
Indeed, a new Labor Code was approved on its first reading in the Duma.
Think about it: Christmas is the main Catholic holiday, but we put more emphasis on the miraculous Resurrection of Christ at Easter.
What is our favorite advertisement?
One in which a simple potato is turned into gold.
Even more control is exercised at the municipal level.
That support, however, is for the man, not his policies.
The Pope’s Dangerous Sex Appeal
After going to the cinema, she and her boyfriend were beaten, before she was brutally assaulted and attacked with an iron rod for more than an hour.
Thirteen days later, she died from her wounds.
But that was not what Pope Benedict XVI had in mind when he spoke recently about the dangers of sexual behavior.
In his pre-Christmas speech to the Roman Curia, the pope did not mention rape, let alone the sexual murder in Delhi.
Fear of sexual behavior is one of the main reasons why most religions establish strict rules concerning sexual relationships.
Restricting sexual conduct to procreation is supposed to make the world safer and more peaceful.
Benedict is not so extreme.
Nor does he advocate violence against homosexuals.
Their victim, a well-educated physiotherapy intern, seems to have been a great deal more modern than her attackers.
That is precisely how the men taunted the young couple: What was an unmarried young woman doing out in the Delhi streets with a young man?
She deserved what was coming to her.
Popes, Saints, and Religious Competition
But the Catholic Church is increasingly losing out to Protestant competition there and elsewhere.
Just look at the statistics.
The Catholic Church understands this competition, but it confronts a chronic shortage of priests.
This phenomenon is most clear in Latin America, but it applies to North America, Asia, and Africa as well.
Pope Benedict XVI’s (2005-2013) large number of saints (44) reflects mainly the large stock of beatified people left behind by John Paul II.
For example, John Paul II became a blessed person a mere six years after his death.
Similarly, Latin America accounted for 9.8% of (non-martyr) canonizations, along with 6.6% for North America, 4.1% for Asia, and 0.8% for Africa.
Combined, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina account for 26% of the world’s Catholics.
Where will the next saints come from?
The Real Mission for Pope Francis
GLENDALE, CALIFORNIA – Catholicism, among the most tradition-bound religions, contains at its core a paradox that has become increasingly sharp.
The chief Jesuit confessor at the papal court used to be called “the black pope,” owing to his simple black cassock (if not his sinister intent).
In order to find a remedy, Francis has appointed a special papal financial commission.
But the bank known as the Institute for Works of Religion, founded in 1942, does not have deep roots in Catholicism.
Though notoriously secretive, the operation is far removed from the Church’s more sensitive, doctrinal core.
At the same time, Francis has launched a series of initiatives aimed at pleasing just about everyone.
The heart of the matter is that Francis’s actions have been in line with the “revolution from above” style of reform associated with Vatican II.
In particular, none of the changes promoted by Francis envision a reduction in papal power.
What is new are the circumstances under which it is unfolding.
Papal authority stands on shaky ground, especially in the comparatively secular West.
If the Church’s first dilemma concerns the basis and effectiveness of papal authority, the second concerns sexuality.
The two are linked.
In the past, policy and politics were a matter for men: now women increasingly play an equal part.
The whole power structure of the family, and the community in which the family lives, begins to change.
Governments today must pay attention to women, though, granted, for many, this is proving hard to do.
The problem lies with men.
A specter is haunting the European Union’s new members in Central Europe ­– the specter of populist nationalism.
What happened?
Technocrats can of course reliably make an electricity plant work better.
The goal is simple: to produce electricity at as low a price as possible.
This is mostly a matter of engineering, not politics.
Instead, some policies are better for some groups, but worse for others.
Different policies benefit and hurt different groups.
Technocrats can sometimes help avoid Pareto inferior policies, that is, policies that make everyone worse off.
The problem was with the proposal.
The logic is simple.
The societies of the Americas were forged by European conquests of indigenous populations, and by the racial and ethnic divisions that followed.
The Europeans then brought millions of African slaves to the Americas.
After emancipation in the nineteenth century, the African-American communities remained impoverished and largely bereft of political rights.
In Peru, for example, Alejandro Toledo is that country’s first indigenous president.
Bolivia has entered a new era of mass mobilization of its long-suffering but now victorious indigenous communities.
But in fact, George C. Marshall, the US secretary of state in 1948, sought to prevent President Harry Truman from recognizing Israel.
But it will not be the same: even if America remains an indispensable nation, it will no longer be the only one.
Post-EU Depression
Then the Hungarian prime minister resigned.
The government of Slovakia lost its majority and is unstable.
Why should this historic event cause such political upheaval?
Addressing conflicts among government coalition parties, as well as within individual government parties, was postponed until after official EU entry.
Polish Prime Minister Lezsek Miller resigned one day after his country's official admission to the EU.
Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Medgyessy was pushed out in late August.
Even the center-right Slovak government was not spared.
The Slovak government is still in power, but it has lost its majority and could fall soon.
In Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, we will now witness a period of unabashed populism.
We know that in football, the most successful teams are not always those with the greatest stars.
Football has often been called a substitute for war – a symbolic, more or less peaceful, way to fight out international rivalries.
On the rare occasion that England wins a big match these days, victory is attributed to a “typically” English fighting spirit, coupled with “fair play.”
In fact, the reality of football styles is rather more complicated.
Italians have abandoned their defensive tactics.
They are, to use his phrase, “mercenaries.”
Many speak several European languages with the fluency of the international businessmen that they also are.
The best European clubs are all multinational now.
Players follow the money.
And the top clubs also happen to be the richest: Real Madrid, Chelsea, Barcelona, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, etc.
During the East Asian crisis of 1997-1998, poverty rose sharply.
The estimated 330 million working women who lived below the poverty line in 2008-2009 accounted for roughly 60% of the 550 million working poor worldwide.
The other 134 million workers who escaped poverty did so earlier, in 2000-2007.
So they should be treated as a call to action.
We know that around one-third of cancers can be prevented.
This finding is important.
Powers of the Future
We have begun to see the “powers of the future,” to borrow the title of former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt’s recent bestselling book.
Chancellor Schmidt is certain of two developments. The United States remains the key player, and China’s power will continue to grow.
Soft power begins with economic power.
America’s twin fiscal and trade deficits may prove to be solvable problems, but new ways will have to be tried to resolve them.
But this is impossible.
We know that the sea level rose by roughly 100 meters during the last 12,000 years.
The air surrounding Greenland and Antarctica has recently become warmer and more humid.
A five-year investigation of Intel may also end with severe penalties.
But the EU should not rejoice at this seeming triumph over American “big business.”
Consider computer operating systems, business accounting software, databases, Internet search engines, silicone chips, broadband services, cable, and cellular telephony.
Remember IBM?
Intel is subject to parallel threats from a myriad of chip and hardware makers.
The new European Commission’s action against the chipmaker Intel is a good example.
The unemployment rate, expected to peak this year at 15%, is now above 25% – and is still rising.
Such were the errors committed over short time horizons.
And, again, even if Greece somehow did achieve the 124% milestone, its debt would still not be sustainable.
We need to use them.
Many more are hospitalized with severe illness.
This realization has led to innovative ideas and experimentation with new laws, regulations, and institutions around the world.
Several proponents of these new ideas have openly used the analogy with drugs.
This is just one example.
For example, you are planning to buy a house.
You can take such a loan provided that an RFP approves such a contract.
He looked me up and down, sized me up, and then said, “Since you are going for so long, I would suggest you keep two strips.”
The United States was the world’s only superpower, so others had to follow.
Now it is back in fashion in Washington.
The tone at the beginning of the second Bush administration is different.
Will Bush’s new approach succeed?
President Lyndon Ronald Bush
But it is America that is leading the attack on fiscal discipline.
Bush's election program promised big tax cuts, which he followed through on.
September 11 th is the second scare story.
The world is now more integrated now than in the 1960s or in the 1980s.
But some other multiethnic societies such as Tanzania and Burkina Faso have largely escaped communal conflict.
Intolerance emanating from organized religion is perhaps the most inexcusable.
And fringe elements often use religion to espouse violence against particular groups.
In recent decades, Roman Catholic and Protestant leaders failed to speak out early and effectively against the genocide in Rwanda.
That said, when it comes to respecting minority rights, democracies have a far better record than autocracies.
This commentary is part of the Carnegie Council Centennial projects.
But this is only part of the problem.
The euro was introduced and quickly became the world’s second currency, behind the dollar.
A system built on a strictly limited mandate could be both more efficient and less controversial than some single, all-encompassing financial regulator.
This is a good and important goal.
·        Make basic medical services and early care and education available to all young children;
It is also about moral responsibility, wisdom, judgment and courage – and about leveraging knowledge to promote positive social change.
Finally, the United Nations Security Council has unanimously agreed a resolution to end the crisis in Lebanon.
However, indiscriminate use of force and continued occupation will never give Israel lasting security.
This has happened before.
If the international community is to remain credible, a regional initiative for collective security – a Madrid II – needs to be taken.
Second, and more radically, pension funds could be barred from investing in domestic government bonds that are not rated, say, A- or higher.
Pricing Corporate Governance
This learning by markets has important implications for both managements of publicly traded companies and their investors.
The introduction of new governance arrangements and their subsequent incorporation into prices is a gradual process, a work constantly in progress.
Prisoners of the Red Army
During Soviet times, February 23 was called the “Day of the Soviet Army and Navy,” and celebrated the creation of the Red Army.
Unfortunately, February 23 is not the only remaining relic of the Red Army.
Another Soviet military legacy is the system of obligatory conscription.
About 500,000 young men are conscripted every year.
The Russian military estimates the total number of draft dodgers to be close to 200,000.
The probability of being drafted is significantly lower for residents of cities with populations of more than 100,000 people.
But this is not true.
This would make February 23 a holiday truly worth celebrating.
At the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), reducing poverty on the African continent through private-sector initiative is our mission.
More than 40% of its population lives on less than a dollar a day.
Guinea-Bissau is also taking advantage of this new private sector-led development approach.
Privatizing Nigeria\u0027s Government
Average incomes are amongst the lowest in the world.
But donors are wary.
Sadly, the answer is a resounding “no.”
But, despite the high price they pay, developing countries get little in return.
Once the discovery is made, it would be licensed.
It would be part of the portfolio of methods for encouraging and supporting research.
But the health care market is not an ordinary market.
The Tuberculosis Front
BERLIN – This has been a good decade in the fight against tuberculosis.
The TB drugs currently in use were developed between 1950 and 1970.
The microscopic test gives false results in nearly half of all cases.
In fact, nine million people develop the active disease every year, and one in five will die.
This places the tubercle bacillus second only to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the list of top microbial killers.
When one’s immune system weakens, the disease may erupt.
Compare this with antibiotic treatment of, say, a urogenital infection, which lasts a few weeks at most.
Promoting Democracy in the Greater Middle East
Our task is to strengthen indigenous political forces pushing for democratic change.
Relatively modest investments in the resilience, redundancy, and integrity of these systems pay high dividends, albeit at random intervals.
The case of New York City is instructive.
There was no pre-built workaround to deliver power by an alternate route.
We have a tendency to underestimate both the probabilities and consequences of what in the investment world are called “left-tailed events.”
Protecting Research and Discovery
Protecting Zimbabwe
The concept of the “responsibility to protect” was adopted unanimously by the UN World Summit in 2005.
Protectionism Made in the USA
The global financial crisis of 1997/1998 - mismanaged by the IMF, largely at the direction of the US Treasury - led to an increased flow of steel imports.
This cannot be allowed.
Protectionism Rides Again
Protectionist Myths
US automakers were convinced during the years of Japan-bashing in the 1980’s that Japan was closed and the US was open.
Even if other economies are closed, open economies still profit from their own free trade.
Consider an analogy.
Consider the following proposed new disorders:
As a result, substance dependence would disappear as a valid category.
The vacuity of the abuse category will now infect the dependence category.
The High Court ruled that it did not.
New York City has banned trans fats from restaurants and is now limiting the permitted serving size of sugary drinks.
Cigarettes are also highly addictive.
The tobacco industry will now take its battle against Australia’s legislation to the World Trade Organization.
That is, after all, where such legislation is most needed.
Muzzling the Dogs of War
Still, Jefferson had it right.
It is thus ever more important that the people of one country participate in the decision to attack the people of another.
Publication is a moral imperative.
Igbo merchants and artisans crowd the famous market of Kano and other northern cities.
And upper and middle class Nigerians everywhere might well choose "Gulder" and "Star" lagers, which are brewed in Lagos.
We stand at a critical juncture.
Russia's size, the poverty of its infrastructure, and the disarray of its bureaucracy limit Putin's power.
So Putin's authoritarianism creeps along, but by Russian standards it is far from being hideously creepy.
That is good for Russia.
Welcome to the republic.
But, because Russia's presidency is so powerful, the Duma is largely a squabbling-shop and a fixer's paradise.
But that is its flaw: it stands only for the president.
What he wants, it votes for.
Tin political ears deserve defeat.
His ego alone kept his Yabloko Party from cooperating with the Union of Right Forces.
Indeed, so far, none of them has more than 2% popular support.
How will power be distributed between Medvedev and Putin?
Russia’s Constitution does not allow for a “technical presidency.”
After all, he served as prime minister for several months in 1999.
The 2008 version of Prime Minister Putin will undoubtedly be stronger than the 1999 version.
So Medvedev will become the next president, and will hold that office for at least one full term.
Putin and Pushkin
The Internet and mass media, not poetry, was to be the catalyst in jump-starting Russia's civil society.
Stalin's "friendship," of course, sent Mandelstam to his grave, and Pasternak, Shostakovich, and Bulgakov all found themselves isolated.
Putin Is An Island
No man is an island, the poet John Donne said.
But there is a critical difference between the Russia of today and even Yeltsin's early postcommunist Russia.
Only the power bureaucracy mattered.
But obstructing is far from overthrowing.
But it is respect for Russia's culture that matters most to them, and such does not come at the barrel of a gun.
So perhaps John Donne was partly right: if Putin is an island, he is one in a sea of millions of islands.
He is a Czar pure and simple.
Poll after poll puts his approval ratings at more than 70%.
He simultaneously advocates multiparty democracy and centralized power.
Putin will be czar no matter what office is formally his own.
What will make this work is that, like any good KGB man, Putin is a master of facades.
What could be more democratic?
After all, the good of democratic structures is their predictability.
After September 11, 2001, many New Yorkers wanted the city’s then Mayor Rudy Giuliani to remain in office.
Putin of Arabia
The Soviet Union lost Egypt in 1972, and its naval bases in Syria were abandoned in 1989.
The city, which looked different and strange, impressed me by its ability to change.
The restaurant had many of the traits found in ethnic restaurants everywhere.
Behind the wall was a stage set of a village yard.
Shinok was just an introduction to today’s new wave of Moscow restaurant culture.
The White Sun existed in Soviet times.
Russian literature is not forgotten.
The palace didn’t impress the American.
The amount of marble used for renovation seemed excessive, and the understanding of what constitutes luxury appeared to correspond to the standards of a Holiday Inn.
At last, the American was excited.
What could be better than to have an ark at hand if one day the political tides turn?

Putin’s Bad-Neighbor Policy
Today, Turkmenistan refuses to cooperate with Russia.
Gazprom has pursued its most public fight with Ukraine, insisting on prices that are 50% higher than what its EU customers pay.
On his way to the Crimea, however, Putin encountered a notorious Russian nationalist motorcycle gang, whose members demand that the Crimea be transferred to Russia.
Putin added insult to injury by talking to his associates rather than to Yanukovych.
Moldova is in a similar predicament.
In 2006, the Kremlin persuaded Uzbekistan to join, but, after Putin visited Tashkent in early June, President Islam Karimov suspended his country’s membership.
Indeed, the West has consistently misread Russia’s intentions on Kosovo.
For example, Putin recently abolished elections in Russia’s provinces.
From now on, presidential appointees will rule a country that is as complex and multi-national as the EU or the US.
When battles were lost, talks began.
These talks eventually resulted in the formation of respected countries, from Italy in the nineteenth century, to India in the middle of the twentieth century, to Eritrea near that century’s end.
Try to imagine Putin as Russia’s leader in 1920, when Poland gained its independence from Russia, or in 1991, when Georgia did.
Nowadays, Rudyard Kipling’s imperialist Great Game is decomposing into a vicious circle.
So it goes, until the rules of the game change.
Manipulating each other, the terrorists and the security guys became indistinguishable.
You will either use him or kill him.
But classical empires learned not to do it to colonized people.
Abolishing democracy in Russia’s provinces, including Muslim-populated regions such as Tatarstan and Dagestan, is a deadly act.
He owes his career to Chechnya, as Bush may owe his presidency to Iraq.
Putin\u0027s Dictatorship of Law Begins Lawlessly
Nor did they have to honor the rights of the nobility, inasmuch as until the middle of the eighteenth century all nobles were their servants.
Such, indeed, it was.
But a faux pas of this kind, if that is what it was, reflects a mentality that places power over law.
The mind-set of these people is geared to achieving their objectives without regard to legal niceties.
Putin’s Final Act
Whenever Russia’s people pour into the streets en masse, as they currently are doing, from that point on things never work out well for the authorities.
In 1991, the Soviet Union –&nbsp;then seemingly an unbreakable monolith – collapsed in just a few months.
Now it is Putin’s turn.
I will never forget what my great-grandmother Nina used to say about the corrupting nature of power in our own family.
When he left the Kremlin in 2000, his secret fortune, from real estate, yachts, horses, and other properties, was estimated to be worth at least $15 million.
The war itself was, of course, predicable and predicted.
He may play a “good cop-bad cop” routine with President Dmitri Medvedev. But the bad cop, Putin, is the real boss.
Third, Russia has been stirring up trouble in South Ossetia and Abkhazia for years.
Where is NATO’s front line?
Are we Russians really the enemy?
If so how should we react?
We Europeans seem to have forgotten our history.
You could not make it up.
This summer, he publicly instructed his education minister to include passages from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago in the high school curriculum.
Putin summarizes his understanding of the scale of the war by recalling the loss of “27 million lives of my compatriots.”
And, when the USSR annexed the Baltic countries, Königsberg, parts of Poland, Finland, Moldova, and Japan, their citizens, too, became Soviet compatriots.
Moreover, while the Munich Agreement cynically blessed Hitler’s dismemberment of Czechoslovakia, it was a public document that meant what it said.
And they dethrone those who got them into trouble.
But this is the new Russian equation.
It knew that the rest of Russia’s colonies – the so-called “Soviet republics” – would want to follow the ungrateful Baltic countries into freedom.
Around the Black Sea, Russia has called into being a series of artificial statelets.
Indeed, Putin openly claims this part of Ukraine as a Russian “internal matter.”
Any plans to “defend” Yanukovich and the eastern part of Ukraine by military force must be confronted.
The Kremlin, far from being able to control the situation, does not fully grasp what is happening.
Russia is moving toward precipice.
Regrettably, Russia’s awakening corresponds with the beginning of the West’s seeming decline.
The “prayer” lasted for no more than 40 seconds, at which point security personnel expelled the performers.
Their song accused Kirill, Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, of kowtowing to the government and advised him to believe in God, not Putin.
So retribution was certain.
The word “blasphemy” was used more and more frequently.
The case also attracted attention in the West.
Dozens of pop stars, from Pete Townshend and Paul McCartney to Madonna, rallied in support of the women.
Of course, Pussy Riot could hardly be classified as musicians.
They were more interested in creating visual images.
Both the feminist chants and the primitive chords were secondary to the spectacle.
They repeated ad nauseam that the cathedral was constructed as a monument to the victory over Napoleon, the 200th anniversary of which is being commemorated this year.
But the new-old church could not turn back time.
The Council quoted St. Paul: “I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said.”
Which side the Holy Virgin takes remains to be seen.
The History of Russia’s Future
MOSCOW – Strategic vision has never been a Russian attribute, and it certainly was absent in 2012.
Similar laws have been adopted in Canada and across Western Europe.
Putin’s Last Stand
WASHINGTON – On April 2-4, NATO will hold its biggest summit ever in Bucharest, the capital of its new member, Romania.
For the first time since 2002, he will.
The same sort of thinking holds true in military/strategic affairs.
Call this strategy "Operation CIS."
When President Alexander Lukashenko departs, Belarus may fold into Russia as East Germany was absorbed by West Germany in the early 1990's.
Likewise, China might oppose "Operation CIS."
Until recently, China feared that Russia's withdrawal from the region would create a vacuum that the US would fill.
It was not his most convincing moment.
Three older missiles, launched in his presence, failed to reach their targets on Kamchatka.
India, which is both poor and democratic, is a happy exception to this rule.
(Europeans need not be envious: growth is quicker when it begins low; think again about puppies.)
Russia's international position is worse than ever.
Practically everything that a Russian citizen can find in a supermarket, including the supermarket itself, is produced or imported by private firms.
You cannot deceive people about growth; they feel the weight of their pockets better than anyone else.
What is fairly new, at least for Russians, is that these "technologies" are efficiently coordinated from the top of the presidential administration.
What is the nature of the new system?
Or is the system simply that of a conniving authoritarian?
The general public approved of this seeming compromise.
This social investment will, it is hoped, be matched by business investment.
The current account balance is to drop to $15 billion in 2004 and $5 billion in 2010.
In the sadly immortal words of Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia’s prime minister during the Yeltsin era, “We wanted for the better, but it turned out to be like always.”
What if the supposed puppet starts to pull the strings?
MOSCOW – In the spring of 2008, Russian President Vladimir Putin was on top of the world.
They will help Russia’s transition as a young democracy.”
In May 2008, Russia won the world hockey championship, beating Canada.
Next came the Eurovision Song Contest, an annual competition of pop (rarely first class) European singers, at which Russia’s Dima Bilan gained first prize for his musical clip “Believe.”
Instead, Putin rules in his own right.
But what is his mandate?
No one knows for certain.
Hints as to the general tenor of his presidency can, perhaps, be found in discovering why Putin’s star rose so meteorically.
All of this makes Yeltsin a tragic figure.
More importantly, he is all things to all people.
Our intelligentsia loves him because he regularly attends theatre, opera, and ballet.
Indeed, his most astonishing attribute is intellectual flexibility, to say what everyone wants to hear.
Not since Gustav Stresemann, Weimar Germany's foreign minister, played the Soviet Union and the West off against each other, has a leader with so weak a hand played his cards so effectively.
True, his democratic Russia was permitted some role in global diplomacy.
But Putin's method is to maintain warm relations with everyone.
For too long Russia practiced either the diplomacy of the thug or that of the Byzantine.
But opportunism is not ideological affinity.
And his communist links are clear.
(Similarly, Mussolini was filmed bare-chested, harvesting corn.)
The strangest thing about the Duma election was that Putin lost his nerve.
He over-exposed himself in public appearances that were as aggressive as they were vague in substance.
United Russia is little more than a bunch of state officials.
Personal authoritarianism rarely survives its founder.
In this climate, no progressive structural reforms are likely.
What kind of budget makes sense?
Moreover, it would be useful to synchronize budgetary decisions with the Parliament’s electoral terms.
Putting Lebanon Together
Today’s crisis in Lebanon is a crisis of the Lebanese state.
The main elements of such an international solution are the following:
It should be international, with the UN’s blessing, but it should not be a UN force.
Putting Youth First
To many of us, the world may seem like an old place.
Nine out of 10 of these young people live in developing countries.
Consider HIV/AIDS: of the 40 million people living with HIV/AIDS, more than a quarter are in their youth.
But most do not have access to it.
There is a universal sensibility that more and more young people share, thanks to the Internet, music, and culture.
In the next 25 years, two billion more people entering our planet will live in the developing world.
It is a platform for political and religious opposition groups in the Arab countries.
Al Jazeera has no shortage of enemies, from the most radical Islamic fundamentalists to American and Israeli intelligence gatherers.
Al Jazeera is not a tool of the CIA, Israel, or Al Qaeda.
For Al Thani, Al Jazeera is integral to the national “branding” of Qatar and its foreign-policy aspirations.
They were right.
So, too, in the US, the smaller banks that largely finance small and medium-size enterprises have been all but neglected.
To allay anxiety about government profligacy, the ECB built conditionality into its bond-purchase program.
That, in a nutshell, is what the Fed and the ECB are saying.
American investors who sell bonds to the Fed will want to diversify the dollars that they receive from it.
Questions for Robert Zoellick
During James Wolfensohn’s presidency of the Bank, there was a change in philosophy.
The old boy system of choosing the head of the World Bank must go.
Raúl Castro Reaches Out
Outside of Cuba, he does not want to be held captive by Cuba’s one international supporter: Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez.
But Raúl Castro wants to avoid dependence on one or two countries alone.
Raúl Castro’s China Strategy
Raúl replaced Fidel as President of the Councils of Ministers and of State, but not as First Secretary of the Cuban Communist Party.
It appears that during an upcoming visit to Havana, the Mexican foreign minister will not meet with local dissidents, breaking with precedents established since 1993.
Race and Republicanism
Since 1990, the US has collected data on ethnic origins.
Thus, there is a distinction between mentioning the original nationality, which is allowed, and mentioning ethnic and racial origins, which is not.
Statistics are not only a reflection of reality: they help to shape it.
Statistical categories often tend to become social categories.
Race and the US Presidential Race
Of course, many people now say that Obama has proven that the “Bradley effect” is a thing of the past.
Racial Medicine\u0027s Revival
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
Not so fast.
An experiment at the University of Pennsylvania resulted in the death of the patient, Jesse Gelsinger, in late 1999.
What is worrisome, however, is the putative "ethnic purity" of the database.
Radical Islam\u0027s Challenge to Indonesia
He is the only viable rival candidate for President Megawati's job, and would be the man to step into the presidential palace should she be removed.
It may not remain so without a firm policy hand at the center.
Because of the government's inactivity, such barriers are rising across the Indonesian archipelago.
Regional autonomy, moreover, has not pacified ethnic tensions.
This restored order.
Their responsible behavior demonstrates the growing importance of Indonesia's civil society.
The Palestinian cause will now resonate louder than ever in the central squares of Cairo, Amman, and Ankara.
He will need this quality to make bold moves on the peace process as well.
Rating the Raters
There is widespread recognition that rating agencies have let down investors.
Rationality versus Intelligence
The thinking errors they uncovered are not trivial mistakes in a parlor game.
Yet assessments of such good (rational) thinking are nowhere to be found on IQ tests. 
As a result, an offshore RMB market, known as the CNH market, was created in Hong Kong alongside the onshore market, now dubbed the CNY market.
That difference led to active exchange-rate arbitrage by mainland importers and multinational firms – one form of capital inflows from Hong Kong to the mainland.
Malaria is a scourge, particularly for inhabitants of poor tropical countries.
In combination with other anti-malarials, they have been used effectively for several years to treat multiple-drug-resistant malaria.
How can we drain the public-policy swamp?
Many of them grew at rates that compared favorably to other emerging markets, if not to China.
There are no shortcuts to progress on addressing these problems, but lessons from the region should inspire emulation.
There are leaders in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) who are also willing to take part.
NATO, however, has stood aside.
But the Alliance refused to hold the scheduled meeting following the Georgia crisis.
In short, we need to retain the hardware, but update the software.
Russia’s initiative for a pan-European security treaty should be the new operating system.
Here, too, reality does not seem to have endorsed Free to Choose.
Above all, Europe means peace.
Peace was at the heart of the ambition of Europe’s founding fathers.
All countries face, to different degrees, economic problems.
But there is a model, simultaneously economic and social, that only Europe embodies.
The road will be long.
But when I arrived for my first meeting at the professor’s office, his bookshelves were lined with volumes bearing Chinese characters.
He was a specialist in what was, at least for me at the time, the wrong Orient.
The good news is that this focus is shifting.
But, with the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Soviet Union, Asia receded from American interest.
American policymakers focused primarily on enlarging NATO to encompass many of the former Warsaw Pact countries, and on contending with the post-Yugoslav wars.
On the contrary, it is still home to massive oil and gas reserves.
The US is right to shift its focus from the Middle East to the Far East.
Regardless of whether the twenty-first century will be another “American century,” it is certain that it will be an Asian and Pacific century.
Re-Setting the NATO-Russia Relationship
Russia, therefore, should apply two fundamental principles that it has already accepted in several declarations.
Russia must make a choice.
What role should the alliance play in the future?
What kind of relations should NATO have with its partners?
The vast majority of respondents were from a migrant background, and a quarter were Muslims whose families had been in Germany for a generation or more.
In terms of ethnic origin and religious practice, they were a representative sample of Germany’s Muslim community.
The study’s conclusions applied only to Germany, but its main findings were largely corroborated by a Gallup global survey.
Military intervention in Iran could go either way.
Where do we go from here?
She won the presidential election in 1990 but the military prevented her from taking power.
The most famous sanctions in recent history were those imposed on South Africa during the apartheid era.
Much of the world community stopped trading with South Africa, and stopped making investments in South African-based enterprises.
Myanmar's HIV/AIDS crisis is now by far Southeast Asia's worst.
Some additional effects are even more pernicious.
Read China’s Lips
Those days are over.
But that’s not the point.
With these considerations in mind, China has adopted a very transparent response.
After all, where else would they place their asset bets?
Why would they risk losses in their massive portfolio of dollar-based assets?
Read their lips.
Read This!
People still haven’t learned to use the technology we already have.
I spent many of my spare hours over the last month adjusting to a new e-mail program after abandoning Eudora and my PC for a Mac with AppleMail.
That makes the message easy to miss, or even to dismiss as spam.
Or perhaps the subject line is useless, like “Message from Juan.”
Or at least I do if the sender has a proper return address.  And, yes, please, he or she should have a full name, such as Alice Haynes, not just Alice.
Or there’s a subject line:  “Message for Esther.”
She could, perhaps, say “Message for President Obama” if she were sharing an open letter, but otherwise…
There are other e-mail sins.
Take the familiar example:  Alice asks, “Could you please introduce me Juan Tigar?”
Even if I know, and I may or may not, Alice should make it easy for me to do her the favor.
You’ve heard of one-click shopping; try one-click introductions.  “Dear Esther,
“Could you please pass along this message to Juan Tigar?
I am a big fan of HotNewThing, and I understand they need a new marketing manager.
But, more often, the message dumps the work on me.
It’s not that I’m mean or lazy. It’s that I have 400 other messages begging for attention.
Other requests that don’t get my immediate attention include the second question in a two-request message.
First, I may not be online and may not even be able to open the attachment or follow the link.
Finally, I’m busy!
I don’t click to a Web site invitation or a presentation.
Will it stand out in a sea of messages?
Will it spur the reader to take the action you want?
Reaffirming Europe
Internally, Europe should remain both an open society and an open economy.
So a return of economic, social, or political nationalism is simply not an option.
Nor will the Israeli military be withdrawn from the strip of land along the Palestinian-Egyptian border.
Reasoning with Iran
This raises the practical question of what Iran’s current bomb-making capability is.
Here, too, Iranian testing would also be easily detected.
Rebalancing Priorities
Rebalancing the Eurozone
This should not be an impossible scenario.
And will China’s coastal export interests again prevail in exchange rate policy decisions, at the expense of poor inland consumers?
Others believed that the euro itself would trigger political unification.
A country in trouble retains primary responsibility for correcting policy.
Rebuilding Haiti From Davos
The economy of the West Bank and Gaza, like Yassir Arafat's headquarters at Ramallah, is in ruins.
In another we assumed that it will remain closed until 2010.
Rebuilding the Brain
How does one prove that a neuron was born at a particular time?
Each cell in the body contains DNA, which is responsible for producing the proteins that are necessary for a cell’s functioning.
When a cell is about to divide, as happens when tissue grows, the DNA in the mother cell has to be doubled, that is, new DNA is synthesized.
One of the paradoxes of this process is that in adult birds and mammals the total number of brain cells remains remarkably constant.
This potential could be used to repair damaged circuits.
This goal is not near.
Since Libya achieved independence in 1951, it has been a fractured state.
These trends were exacerbated after Muammar el-Qaddafi overthrew the king in 1969.
This led to what the scholar Moncef Djaziri described as a division of formal and informal authority.
The political systems of these countries were tailored to small, static, rural populations.
Now these societies must cope not only with vast urban centers, but also with the very different talents and demands of urbanized people.
For example, international bodies such as the WTO have changed the framework within which economic decisions are taken.
A New York-based firm, the Assura Group, has been working for four years on a plan to launch privately issued supplemental unemployment insurance to anyone.
These securities are offered in pairs –one long and one short – and, unlike in a government-run scheme, in whatever quantity the market demands.
In France, May 10 is a day to commemorate the abolition of slavery.
Except for the Balkans, most European nations are at peace with each other.
The genes of war now express themselves on the soccer field; competition for land has been replaced by competition for medals and titles.
It started with the Jews and acknowledgement that the Vichy regime did indeed incarnate the French state.
It has created a central authority serving as an umbrella for diverse organizations.
Reconciling Hamas and Fatah
Furthermore, the question of including Hamas in the Palestine Liberation Organization is crucial.
Unsurprisingly, the fate of the Cairo talks is anything but certain.
After 1989, human rights were understood as a universal code to tame state despotism.
What would be its work?
This court would be a place for civic and civilized settlement between ethnic minorities and state sovereignty.
The International Court for Minorities that I propose would be both therapeutic and preventative.
They will continue to pose that threat unless the world acts.
How should they be provided with food, water, health care, and shelter?
Haiti, like its next-door neighbor, the Dominican Republic, once created jobs in port facilities, including production of clothing, baseballs, and other light-manufacturing items.
Kenya is aflame after a presidential election on December 27 widely believed to have been rigged to secure the re-election of Mwai Kibaki.
It appeared overwhelmingly likely that the presidential vote count would similarly show Odinga beating Kibaki by a wide margin.
That, indeed, is how the early count transpired.
Then the trouble began.
Recovering America’s “Smart Power”
We are not alone.
The effects of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks have also thrown us off course.
Recovering from Kosovo
Without NATO intervention, they probably would have remained second-class citizens within Serbia.
Recovery before Reform
At the heart of the political check was America’s Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.
Redeeming the United Nations
We got hit from both sides of the debate and disappointed both sets of expectations.
As Mahatma Gandhi put it, “You must be the change you wish to see in the world.” The UN is no exception.
This week’s summit will be the largest single gathering of world leaders in human history.
Redefining Sustainable Development
To find a solution, we must start by clarifying the problem.
But this view is no longer tenable.
This week, my colleagues and I published a report called Sustainable Development Goals for People and Planet, which outlines what is required.
Like Einstein’s thought experiment, many lives depend on it.
Indeed, China will get there much sooner.
Multiple problems affect employment.
Redesigning Capitalism
The first task is already being tackled.
The second task remains open.
Some states (Iceland and Hungary) are clearly bankrupt.
All of these problems are so difficult to resolve because they have been festering for so long.
These innovations were considered technical successes.
Under their pressure, more and more processes were “outsourced.”
As a result, consumption weakened, unsteady employment grew, and unemployment stopped declining.
Today’s crisis marks the end of economic growth fueled only by credit.
Rediscovering the West
Sometimes the two methods - consultation without action in Europe, actions without consultation in the US - can be turned to mutual advantage.
Many democracy activists have been arrested throughout the country.
At one time, there may have been a kernel of truth to this.
But that time is past.
Second, the Europeans have now chosen three managing directors in a row who resigned before the end of their term.
June 10 is the deadline for nominations.
In that case, it will go to Lagarde.
Peacekeeping and crisis prevention are accepted functions of the UN.
This last point has been at the heart of the problems in Iraq.
Some retail banks went belly-up, like Northern Rock, while others stayed afloat (Santander’s UK subsidiary, for example).
Vickers gives short shrift to some of the more beguiling options.
But there is a sting in the tail.
Such a requirement would impose costs on universal banks by constraining their ability to transfer capital within the group.
Economists have been more influential over the last 15 years than at probably any other time in history.
The trouble is that these universal principles are not self-executing: they do not automatically translate into clear-cut institutional arrangements or policy prescriptions.
How can such "social accounting" be done? Again, simplicity rules.
But firms that lay off more workers  should  pay more. 
This is also wrong: not only does it lead to a long, uncertain process, but there is no reason for judges to be involved in the first place.
Reforming Europe from Below
Before the advent of the euro, local markets were small and illiquid.
Reforming Germany\u0027s Army
MUNICH: What are the military threats European countries now face?
What forces are required to meet them?
The debate over these issues has now reached West Europe's biggest army, Germany's Bundeswehr.
In 1994 the last Russian soldier left German soil.
Earlier this week, the Commission's report was published.
The 179 page document does not mince words.
The Bundeswehr has no future in its current structure.
Germany is no longer threatened by invading armies; she is surrounded by allies in Nato and partners in the EU.
In other words: the number of soldiers needed for the new tasks goes up, while the total of the armed forces goes down.
This may not be the last word in the debate.
That is why it is safe to say: reform of the Bundeswehr is finally under way.
Soon the House of Councillors will submit its final report.
But this ad-hoc approach has been, and remains, a recipe for paralysis.
Under this system, voters can only vote for political parties as a whole, and thus have no influence on the order in which candidates are elected.
In closed-list systems, the candidate lists should be zippered: male, female, male, female (or vice versa).
In open-list systems, a 50% quota should be adopted.
But if these countries replace their open lists with closed lists, the percentage of women elected should, all else remaining equal, increase by around 10%.
One way to enforce the rules may be to say that parties that do not comply with the legislation in a district should not be able to run candidates there.
But lists alone won’t do the trick.
Indeed, another necessary component of such reforms is the adoption of medium-sized to large-sized districts for the election of national legislators.
Women have the most difficultly reaching office in single-seat districts.
The benefits from these reforms are two-fold.
Reforming Russia’s Military Industrial Complex
The country’s military-industrial sector suffers from limited domestic orders and extensive overcapacity.
As a result, Russia’s leading defense firms remain heavily dependent on foreign sales.
Housing versus Habitat
But what is meant by unacceptable varies greatly from country to country.
Piped water, sewerage, and electricity are seen as essential in the Americas, but not in India.
The problem is that people do not demand houses; they demand habitats.
The ability to connect to all of these networks makes a habitat valuable.
After all, much of what makes a house a habitat lies outside of his department’s purview.
Finally, the state competes with the private sector via state-owned enterprises and utilities.
Given that an effective PRI safeguards market order and stability, the market needs a strong state to manage it.
Fiscal deficits must be cut to reduce debt levels.
Finally, Greece could leave the euro and devalue its currency.
And the third would destabilize the euro, possibly resulting in a run on some other EU countries.
·        The American system.
Profligate states go bankrupt if necessary.
·        The German system.
According to the German Constitution, the German states (or Länder) will not be permitted any budget deficit after 2020, and must already pursue fiscal consolidation in order to meet that goal.
It is time for Europe to face its true options in order to maintain the euro’s stability – and that of the EU itself.
But the theory has been overextended.
For example, solar power plants in America’s Mohave Desert could supply more than half of the country’s electricity needs.
General Motors might have an early version by 2010.
What formalities must customers complete if they want to open an account in another EU country?
Some national governments have their part to play, too.
Reinventing Science Education
To be sure, the need for more and better science education has not been entirely ignored.
The conventional view is that there is little problem with post-secondary science education.
And, as the cradle of the world’s first democracy, Greece needs other symbols of national renewal than scepters and robes.
Natural-gas fields in the Eastern Mediterranean are estimated to hold up to 122 trillion cubic feet, enough to supply the entire world for a year.
All countries involved have maritime disputes and political disagreements.
Lebanon and Israel do not have diplomatic relations.
The ECSC became the core of today’s European Union.
These steps could lead in turn to a Turkish, Cypriot, and Greek energy partnership that would provide positive incentives for Turkish-Israeli reconciliation.
The EU does not have a Queen Elizabeth.
In addition, the controversy over who should rule Western Sahara remains an obstacle to full normalisation of Algerian-Moroccan relations.
Therefore, an ad hoc funding mechanism must be defined, in the form, say, of a donor conference.
But outside help is essential.
The organization must reformulate its mission, moving away from the idea of being the “West’s Bank,” the “BRICS’ Bank,” or, for that matter, a bank at all.
These are exceptions.
As a result, pluralism pressures churches to become denominations.
Within Christianity, for well-known historical reasons, Protestantism has had a comparative advantage in adapting to pluralism.
Acceptance of the market economy has been slower, but that, too, has begun since the encyclical Centesimus Annus of John Paul II.
Eastern Christian Orthodoxy is, however, a different matter.
A self-confident community will usually do just that.
Remaking the Middle East
As long as governments were friendly and backed regional stability, there was no need for outsiders to encourage representative government.
Closed economic systems also pose a danger.
“I have come too late.” After that, he existed more as an historical chimera than as a real person.
And there is real life.
The consequences of war are encountered everywhere, nowhere more so than for those caught in the crossfire.
We saw what Save the Children is trying to do about it, at a nutrition center serving mothers and children in Gaza City.
The Qattan Center for the Child is a privately funded library – and drama, computer, and youth center – that would grace any British community.
The director told me it is dedicated to the credo of “building people not buildings.”
The center is a true oasis.
The responsibility lies, first and foremost, with Israel.
That is true, too.
The focus has shifted.
Remembering the First \
In June, NATO's leaders commemorated the 60th anniversary of D-Day, the allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France.
That July, terrorists in Bosnia assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of the Habsburg Empire.
Austria responded by invading Serbia, Bosnia's neighbor and an "upstart" Slavic power.
Great Britain came to the defense of Belgium and France.
The Iraq War is not WWI.
Remembering the Gulag
As the example of Saddam Hussein teaches us anew, to overturn a monument is easier than to try a dictator.
It depicts the Solovki monastery, a historical complex on an island in the White Sea, which also served as the earliest and one of the most important camps in the Gulag.
The design raises some challenging questions.
The work of mourning, to use Freud's formula, is continuous.
In some cases, monuments are erected not on the former murder sites, as in Germany, but near them.
Even such proximate memory is far from being the rule in Russia.
There is not a single plaque commemorating the Leningrad KGB's victims near the site of their suffering.
Such a monument is also notably absent from the vicinity of the Kremlin.
The museum on Solovki Island fills just a few rooms inside the functioning monastery.
Some local museums display fascinating objects.
How many died here, and when?
By matching the number of skeletons and their gender, every "shooting protocol" was identified with a certain grave.
About 9,000 people were shot at Sandarmokh between 1937-1938.
Sandarmokh is the most important, and best developed, Russian site of memory.
In St. Petersburg, the stone is complemented with inscriptions, such as "To the victims of Communism."
Far more than Nazism, Communism belongs to our common European heritage.
The memory of its victims is not only a national, but also a European responsibility.
Capitals may be renamed.
In 1961, the mummy of Stalin was observed striding out of the Mausoleum in Red Square.
Lenin's corpse remains there, but his departure is expected.
The result is the permanency of the past in the present.
In the digital age, the opposite is true: cheap computer storage, powerful processors, and ubiquitous Internet access have made remembering the norm.
By contrast, deciding what to delete is costly.
So we click “save” just in case.
Instead, the past is always present, ready to be called up with a few clicks on a keyboard or mobile phone.
His advice is essentially to practice a form of digital abstinence.
Too much self-censoring of what we do online would deny us the benefits of the Internet.
First, we could give digital files “expiration dates,” so that our digital systems would delete the file when the appropriate time comes.
Yet it is not just how information is stored and retrieved that needs to change, but how we think about information as well.
The onus is on us as much as it is on the computer.
Remembering Zhao Ziyang
The only reason for Zhao’s continued ill treatment was his opposition to the violent repression of the Tiananmen Square protest in 1989.
It should have been his decision to make as General Secretary, but things were not as they should have been.
Half a million college students in Beijing alone were involved in this movement.
Under Zhao’s direction, the Politburo and its Standing Committee called for dialogue with the students.
The Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989 was a tragedy for China, and another tragedy for the twentieth century.
China, India, and the Philippines are the three largest recipients of remittances, while Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Vietnam are also in the top ten.
The fourth Global Forum on Remittances, which runs May 20-23 in Bangkok, will do just that.
More than 215 million people around the world live outside of the countries they call home.
Renewed Hope for Renewable Energy
There are serious plans to turn the Sahara desert’s heat and sunlight into Europe’s major power source, supplying energy to half a billion people.
Yet skeptics might say: must we really add yet another set of letters to the alphabet soup of global bureaucracy?
These countries recognize the potential for renewable energy, especially new off-grid solutions in rural areas.
IRENA may not be a component of the UN system, but it should be regarded as part of the family from the outset.
In a sense, that change has now arrived.
ATHENS – The year 2009 has been one of great change, taking place amidst even greater uncertainty.
Afghanistan is a case in point.
I think we are witnessing something new being born.
If you were President Richard Nixon, there was no ignoring what appeared on the front page of The New York Times .
With every shift in medium, there is a period of mourning for the old one.
America’s Pacific Rebalance
We continue to develop Guam as a strategic hub, and plan to establish fully capable Marine Air-Ground Task Forces in Japan, Guam, and Hawaii.
The US military is also rebalancing within the Asia-Pacific region to place more emphasis on new partnerships in Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean.
We also increased the number and frequency of US Air Force aircraft rotating through Northern Australia.
The final pillar of the US rebalance is force projection.
It is not.
America is and always will be a Pacific nation.
Recent evidence suggests that it would not.
Between July 2005 and September 2008 (before Lehmann Brothers’ bankruptcy), the renminbi appreciated 22% against the dollar.
American companies cannot compete with these countries either.
The other narrative speaks to an opposing, but equally valid reality.
This is not just about socio-economic issues.
There is also a political angle.
With two competing, yet simultaneously valid narratives, ideological extremes harden.
It is high time to move on five fronts, simultaneously:
Rescuing a Revolution
In politics, too, Yushchenko is playing with fire, having lost the support of most of “Our Ukraine,” the party he created.
As a result, the party has been reduced to junior-partner status in Tymoshenko’s coalition government.
Moreover, unlike in the case of Israel, the radical wing in Palestine represents the democratic majority, as it emerged victorious from the elections two years ago.
Rescuing Georgia
Eduard Shevardnadze's time had long since past.
But these investments brought no economic trickle down.
Indeed, Transparency International, a watchdog group, calls Georgia one of the 10 most corrupt nations in the world.
The rule of law that Shevardnadze promised existed merely on paper.
If this problem is not resolved, foreign investors, let alone tourists, will continue to view Georgia as unstable and stay away.
America once again must participate in nation building, and it cannot do so on the cheap.
But a flourishing democracy there will have inevitable spillover effects on Georgia's neighbors, Azerbaijan and Armenia.
What better--and more cost-effective--way to secure the trans-Caucasus pipelines than through democratic legitimacy?
It's that simple.
There is no shortcut.
The possibility that non-state actors could acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction poses an especially grave new threat.
For example, some countries want to develop smaller and "usable" nuclear weapons designed for pre-emptive or preventive military action.
Rescuing the Amazon Forests
Latin American countries in the Amazon region, for example, are home to what can rightly be considered the world’s storehouse of biodiversity.
Five hundred years ago, the Atlantic rainforest stretched nearly the entirety of Brazil’s 8,500-kilometer coastline; today, less than 7% remains.
Rescuing Yemen
For him, the attempted Christmas Day bombing was a gift from heaven.
The West and Saleh do not have the same enemy.
More than half of Yemen’s territory is falling out of government control.
This transfer has dramatically increased over the past two decades.
Europe today is both larger and different compared to the Europe of 1999, when Turkey was invited to begin the accession process.
But the EU always faces problems, resolves them, and moves on.
Today, we don’t have a treasury, but we are about to have something similar.
The EU-Turkey relationship began with an association agreement signed in 1963.
Turkey’s neighborhood is our neighborhood; its problems are our problems.
In Bosnia-Herzegovina, EU-Turkey cooperation is fundamental to achieving a durable solution.
And we said: Turkey will be an EU member.
I supported the signature of that document; I would do the same today.
It means something much deeper and well defined.  It means Turkey’s admission to the EU.
But the ecology of supply chains is not as straightforward as this depiction suggests.
Technology has enabled faster, more efficient “just-in-time” delivery, taking full advantage of specialization and knowledge-sharing on a global scale.
When China initiated its economic reforms in 1979, it inherited a centrally planned economy that lacked the institutional infrastructure for markets.
Resilient Brazil
Nevertheless, the devil is in the details.
Resilient China
Such psychological factors will need continual nurturing.
Resilient India
But, since 1991, India has liberalized its economy and profited from globalization.
That said, India has relied much less on foreign direct investment than China, and has even exported FDI to OECD countries.
But India is already bouncing back.
So, for those looking for signs of recovery from the global economic downturn, India remains the place to watch.
Hugging a Burning Tree
But the West uses the other 40% of biomass to produce heat, and it will increasingly use it to generate electricity.
Biomass (along with hydropower) can be used to smooth the fluctuations inherent to wind and solar.
Biomass is experiencing a revival, because it is considered CO2-neutral.
The developed world’s re-enchantment with biomass could take it down a similar road.
Studies are just beginning to estimate the impact.
In Denmark, a group of researchers estimated by how much various energy crops would reduce CO2 emissions.
But burning the willow releases 22 tons of CO2.
And, in a market system, almost all of the barley production simply moves to a previously unfarmed area.
Ten years ago, the EU and the US embraced biofuels as a way to combat global warming.
Restart the Talks on Cyprus
Ever since UN peacekeepers were deployed in 1964, the UN has been the only party acceptable to all sides as a “midwife of compromise.”
Europe’s Green Recovery
And none can be resolved without addressing the others.
Restrain the Northern Alliance
Anti-Poverty 2.0
But aid conditionality and treaty commitments have significantly constrained policymaking in most developing countries, especially the poorest.
Meanwhile, measurement controversies continue to cast doubt on actual progress.
The mixed record of poverty reduction calls into question the efficacy of conventional approaches.
Of course, there have been remarkable scientific breakthroughs since 1981.
Scientists established that a previously unknown retrovirus was the cause of AIDS, and determined that the virus was primarily transmitted through sexual contact.
And an unprecedented amount of funds has been invested in HIV treatment and prevention.
There is a widespread misperception in the developed world that we have already won the battle against HIV/AIDS.
Sub-Saharan Africa has 10% of the world’s population, but is home to 70% of those living with HIV/AIDS.
So, it is worth asking another question: what could we achieve with just a small increase in the current funding?
Their new research will be essential input.
So where is it best to spend more first?
President Clinton announced the accord; Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat signed nothing.
The same could all too easily happen again.
Some point a finger at Ariel Sharon, citing his provocative visit to the Temple Mount area of Jerusalem.
Diplomacy must be tailored to fit the opportunity; at Camp David, President Clinton pushed for more than Arafat was going to endorse.
Doves and moderates on either side of the divide are in retreat.
This could be the case in today’s Middle East.
In this case, the two sides would still have to script events.
Palestinians living outside the area would be able to move to the new Palestinian state but not to Israel.
By now, emigration is more than three million, about a quarter of the population.
Yet when Mugabe was introduced at the most recent meeting of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in Zambia’s capital, Lusaka, his fellow heads of state heartily applauded him.
The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 was probably the last masterpiece of Franco-German creativity.
Of course, the Franco-German engine cannot function as before.
So what can be done to generate a new sense of leadership around the Franco-German axis?
The election a year ago of French President Nicolas Sarkozy might have promised a new era of cooperation.
Indeed, closer Franco-British cooperation should be viewed as a positive development, for it pulls the United Kingdom once more towards Europe.
And German-British relations are also improving.
Poland has that leadership potential, even if Germany will remain the glue between East and West.
What is happening now – the second stage of the global financial crisis – was no less predictable.
Other countries have gone through similar experiences.
Park takes over at a pivotal point in South Korea’s history.
The task is no less than to achieve South Korea’s second miracle on the Han River.
Reviving Europe’s Universities
Germany’s top university, Heidelberg, ranks 58th.
Finally, Europe must place more emphasis on basic research.
Basic research is the primary organism in the food chain of scientific endeavor.
In 2003, Denmark’s universities were turned into self-governing institutions run by governing boards dominated by external representatives.
Reviving Georgia’s Western Dream
A poll conducted by the International Republican Institute in September 2007 indicated that 81% of Georgians support joining the EU.
An EU-Georgia ENP Action Plan was signed in November 2006, but it is unlikely to meet expectations.
This makes all the difference.
Reviving Muslim Democracy
The vote demonstrated that Bangladesh’s 153 million people have little appetite for bringing Islamism into politics.
Bangladesh needs only to look west to India and Pakistan to see the threat posed by Islamist terrorism.
Many know that interest rates on three-month US Treasury bills became slightly negative in September 2008 – for the first time since 1941.
People are also aware that the stock market has not been this volatile since the Great Depression (with the single exception of October 1987).
But then, not all economic convulsions are alike.
The Standard &amp; Poor’s Composite fell by 20.5%, the FTSE 100 by 12.2%, and the Nikkei 225 by 14.9% the next day.
Confidence is a psychological phenomenon, and can make seemingly capricious jumps up as well as down.
Reviving the Quartet
The Quartet has been dormant since 2000, because any peace process requires negotiations between the parties in conflict.
Four steps are needed to restart such a process.
The first step, revival of the Quartet, has already been taken.
The Quartet should consult with the individual parties and to specify them further.
A Europe of Solidarity, Not Only Discipline
To that end, I recently established an Open Society Initiative for Europe (OSIFE).
During the German occupation, my father was also a heroic figure.
He helped to save his family and friends and many others.
That is what gave me the idea.
And other better-off countries could join them.
But this has to be a European project –&nbsp;one that eventually must find its way into the European budget.
Revolts of the Righteous
And they did so with the moral authority of their Buddhist faith.
But Buddhism has been a religion in different parts of Asia for many centuries, and, like any other belief, it can be used to justify violent acts.
Just as the Buddhists risked their lives to stand up for democracy in Burma, Christians have done so in other countries.
The Marcos regime in the Philippines was doomed in the mid-1980’s from the moment the Catholic Church turned against it.
Active resisters to the Nazis during World War II were often devout Christians.
It is, on the whole, not beneficial to be ruled by such heroes, but it is good to have heroes around when they are needed.
Revolutionary Shadows
I was offered a taste of this as a guest on a well-respected TV cultural program.
I assumed that I was supposed to be provoked into unguarded comments, a method that fashionable TV journalists everywhere use nowadays.
The journalist considered Codreanu a “Romantic hero.”
Soon after, the national committee for the media condemned the program.
In fact, the responses from members of the public to these controversies were mostly of a vulgar nationalistic and anti-Semitic tone.
Romania is not alone, of course, in reliving this dark comedy.
We were discussing Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice.
Revolutionizing Arab Economies
For the first time since 1986, Tunisia’s economy shrank in 2011, by 1.8%.
In Tunisia, too, the budget deficit has widened sharply in the wake of the revolution, rising from 2.6% of GDP in 2010 to 6% in 2011.
Rewriting Russia\u0027s Recent Economic History
It did not.
That goal was not a part of the reformers' vision.
What they achieved was undiluted decline.
No rewriting of history will change this.
If they do, the doors to prosperity will open.
And isn’t that already happening?
Let us compare, for example, Brazil in 2010 with the United Kingdom in 1960.
So today’s emerging-market economies should be richer than today’s advanced economies were back then, right?
Wrong – and by a substantial margin.
Tacit knowledge is acquired mostly through learning by doing.
That is how we train musicians, barbers, doctors, and scientists.
Consider how long it takes an adult to learn to speak a language or a musician to master the violin.
How do people learn to do jobs that do not yet exist?
The productivity of Nuevo León, Mexico, is higher than in South Korea, but that of Guerrero, another Mexican state, resembles levels in Honduras.
The exceptions often confirm the rule.
Rich Europe, Poor Europe
In 1960, disparities in what later came to be known as the EU-15 were about twice as large as those between US states.
Today, they are comparable with American income disparities.
So perhaps it is more useful to compare the 50 US states with the EU’s 72 regions. 
But they have come down by nearly one-third over the past 12 years.
It’s time to start thinking seriously about how to make Europeans move.
They are also home to thousands of new companies, many of which are quickly becoming large, global leaders in their fields.
The MGI CompanyScope, a new database of all companies with revenues of $1 billion or more, reveals that there are about 8,000 large companies worldwide.
Three-quarters of them are still based in developed regions.
The composition of the Fortune Global 500 is a case in point.
But this, too, is changing fast.
We estimate that about 280 cities – among the candidates are Campinas (Brazil), Daqing (China), and Izmir (Turkey) – could host large companies for the first time.
As recently as 2001, only 5% of outward FDI came from non-OECD countries; by 2011, that share had soared to 21%.
China’s outward FDI rose by almost 50% per year from 2004 to 2010; Brazil, Singapore, and Hong Kong have been major investors in Europe.
Those who have been writing obituaries for the emerging-market boom should give serious consideration to these trends.
The new breed of emerging-market multinational is diversifying its revenue around the world.
The global economy is now their platform.
And, because tax revenues, too, will not recover, the gap will have to be bridged by fiscal austerity.
Leprosy is one of the world’s oldest diseases.
It has a physical dimension, but also social and psychological components.
It was only in the latter part of the twentieth century that a truly effective chemotherapy became available.
The disease is caused by a bacillus called Myobacterium leprae, first identified in 1873 by G.H. Armauer Hansen.
Leprosy is thus an infectious disease; it is not hereditary, let alone a divine punishment.
Last year, there were under 250,000 new cases of leprosy reported in the world, over half of them in India.
Rights for Robots?
There is even a Robot World Cup, though, judging by the standard of the event held in Graz, Austria, last summer, footballers have no need to feel threatened just yet.
(Chess, of course, is a different matter.)
Hanson Robotics has a demonstration model called Albert, whose face bears a striking resemblance to that of Albert Einstein.
In his book Love and Sex with Robots , David Levy goes further, suggesting that we will fall in love with warm, cuddly robots, and even have sex with them.
But what if they become sufficiently complex to have feelings?
Rio’s Unsustainable Nonsense
But what does that have to do with either the environment or “sustainability?”
At what cost?
In the end, therefore, water availability cannot properly be called a “right.”
Africa is a paradox.
Who will control and utilize them?
Who will be included or excluded?
And we need to share those resources equitably.
Africa’s people must be allowed to gain confidence, dignity, and a sense of self-worth.
There are indications of good governance in many countries.
If so, the obvious question is why China’s future rulers are circulating a foreign classic on social revolution.
For the Party, this development is clearly worrying.
It is now ceding the commanding heights of Chinese politics to autonomous representatives of social forces that it cannot control.
One such episode was the sale of tainted baby formula in 2008.
Rising Uncertainties in the U.S. Economy
Optimism turns to euphoria turns to pessimism turns to panic.
I am no pessimist, even less a doomsayer.
Risky Advice
And yet scientific advisers face strong temptations and pressures to treat every uncertainty as a risk.
In what senses?
Instead, they were “early warnings” offered by dissenting voices.
As we know from the work of Thomas Kuhn and other philosophers of science, dominant paradigms do not always turn out to be the most accurate.
A Year on the Brink
In Spain, independence movements, especially in Catalonia, have revived, while neo-Nazism is on the march in Greece.
Most disappointing to reformers has been the official rejection of the “Glass-Steagall” approach to banking reform.
Salvation does not lie in better “risk management” by either regulators or banks, but, as Keynes believed, in taking adequate precautions against uncertainty.
Are they right?
Why is it called a prize in “economic sciences,” rather than just “economics”?
These fields have “science” in their names to distinguish them from their disreputable cousins.
Scientists had to announce themselves as scientists.
Hence there is no longer any need for the term “astronomical science.”
But physics is not without such critics, too.
Economics has an important quantitative side, which cannot be escaped.
Robert Rubin Revisited
Here are my four favorites.
But governments are not like households or companies.
They can always get the money they need by issuing bonds.
With near-zero interest rates, most Western governments cannot afford not to borrow.
The national debt is a burden on future generations.
Propositions in economics are rarely absolutely true or false.
Above all, the truth of many propositions depends on people’s expectations.
But such people exist only in economists’ models.
LONDON – Was the British government’s decision to embrace austerity in the wake of the global financial crisis the right policy, after all?
The UK was the only country that made an effort to pay.
The reality of the 1976 bailout is even more complicated.
There were also the two defaults through inflation in 1920 and 1923.
Rockets into Ploughshares
This internal and external brain drain will impact Russia's economy for decades to come.
Yet, all is not lost.
Compared to R&D activities, fundamental research is cheap and it is here that, although damaged, a solid Russian tradition remains that can be built upon.
Adaptation is underway.
Outside influences also matter.
But it is not nearly enough.
In science, a dictatorship of reason is combined with the freedom of ideas.
First, the name of Russia's next president is now known.
Second, his name is Dmitriy Rogozin, the Motherland Party's most famous politician.
And now?
It is Rogozin who articulates all three in the most spectacular, persistent, and public manner.
But no such caution restrains US senators like South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, who says that the “evil (of) a nuclear … Iran” will affect the US “far more than (any) conflict.”
And not just with the US.
Yet, despite increasing economic costs, Iran’s response only hardened.
Iran sits at the heart of an extremely volatile region.
The country’s Shia footprint stretches from the Mediterranean to the Hindu Kush.
As India’s foreign minister, I engaged in successful talks with Iran frequently.
That, not Western bluster and sanctions, is the way ahead.
And now that effort has led Europe to its latest impasse.
Private risks must be privately borne.
By 2009, the IMF’s Article IV Staff Report was already ringing the alarm bells.
This is a remarkable outcome, given that the risks have been so well known and understood.
Indeed, the Cypriot authorities have been engaged in ongoing discussions with the troika for the past year.
Roman Polanski’s American Dream
In 1943, after a life of petty crime, the writer Jean Genet faced another prison sentence for theft, when Jean Cocteau declared that Genet was a literary genius.
(Think of Oscar Wilde, who, like Polanski, found refuge in Paris.)
The Americans, and to an extent the British, sometimes pay a different kind of tribute to famous artists.
A particularly nasty example was the case of “Fatty” Arbuckle, a great comedy actor in Hollywood’s silent-movie era.
This, too, was an exaggeration, but Tocqueville had a point.
This is not an unlikely outcome.
Americans can be generous.
Romania\u0027s Hysteria
The gap between the rulers and the ruled widens everyday.
When that happens, a country is in trouble, and I think Romania already is there.
And how can voters judge the two candidates?
Contrary to the view that emotions interfere with clear thinking, the ability to understand and regulate emotions can result in more effective thinking.
Perhaps the flexibility that Obama and Romney have shown is not such a bad quality for a president after all.
I do not mean the slick books and television advertisements that are produced for their campaigns.
When the Chinese student movement broke out in 1989, I was pursuing a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of California-Berkeley.
I have tried three times to return to my homeland, only to see China block each attempt at the Hong Kong airport.
Exile is not freedom.
He was an undergraduate at the University of Geneva and completed his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1971.
In 1975 he accepted an offer from the MIT Department of Economics, where he taught until his death.
The topic was exchange rates, output, and interest rates; the style was elegant and deceptively simple, with complex models reduced to the interaction of two curves.
For some time, indeed, such diagrams were known as "Dornbusch diagrams".
For example, he applied the lessons of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire to the break-up of the Soviet bloc.
Despite his public persona, Rudi was an excellent confidential policy adviser.
Rule I: No More Nation-building
For this reason, among others, the enterprise has not found favor with the American public.
Rule II: Concentrate on the Elephants
The functional equivalents of elephants are Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East.
Rule III: Raise the Gasoline Tax
NEW YORK &#45;&#45; Several years ago, my daughter lay in a coma after a serious fall.
One clutched a pouch of blood and the other held my daughter’s medical dossier.
War is widely thought to be linked to economic good times.
Investments in education, health, research, and the environment will almost inevitably be crowded out.
But that is another matter.
uncertainties arising from the unfinished "war on terrorism";
War, and anticipation of war, bring both.
We should be prepared for them.
The public had tired of a civilian regime marked by corruption and economic chaos.
The political core of his regime had become hollow.
The generals have always placed the institution of the military above all else, including rulers from their own ranks.
June’s G-20 summit in Toronto, although not very effusive on trade, did not back away from it.
Policy is driven by three “I’s”: ideas, institutions, and interests (i.e., lobbies).
This lesson has been well learned.
Rushdie a la Russe
June will be a cruel month in Russia's courts.
Religion."
The organizers of the exhibition stated that they wanted to attract attention to the new role of religious institutions in Russian life.
Who, precisely, were these powerful enemies?
Russia and the Kosovo Card
(Crimea was ceded to Ukraine by Nikita Khrushchev only in 1954).
Since then, oil has fuelled an Azeri military buildup.
Russia and the West After Iraq
Where do its interests lie, and what kinds of policy should its leaders pursue?
In particular, how should Russia position itself vis-à-vis the incipient rivalry between Europe and the United States?
A struggle for preserving the vestiges of greatness may be a worthy goal; perhaps France, a country richer than Russia, can afford these objectives.
For both France and Germany, the Iraq issue is a crucible for forging an autonomous foreign/security policy for the European Union.
Both views are delusions.
In today's world, Russia's business is Russia.
This served as a guarantee of "international political immunity" for Russia.
In addition to the new Europe now coming into being, a new West is taking form, one spanning the Atlantic to the Pacific.
Russia Crosses the Line
Each side will argue its own version.
It was and remains regime change in Georgia.
This is why it quickly opened a second front in the other disputed Georgian territory, Abkhazia, just south of Sochi.
What should the West do now?
Russia is part of the problem, not the solution.
The first was on a boat and ended with dinner with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin at Sochi on the Black Sea.
The first was the intense media interest.
It was Putin’s yoke, not history’s, which lay heavily on Russia.
Countries are not genetically programmed like animals.
Cynics say that this is simply a deceptive “good cop-bad cop” routine.
Moreover, Medvedev’s main strategic goal must be to secure a second term as president.
Why the change?
Putin himself has furnished proof of that.
This is crucial.
Russia\u0027s \
Russia's long-term interests in Iran require permanent engagement.
Russia’s “Oil-for-Knowledge” Scheme
Whenever you fill up your European compact car’s gas tank, or that of your American SUV, you pay as much as a Russian schoolteacher earns in a month.
Contemporary Russians consume competitive products: Nestle cereals, Mercedes cars, Hollywood movies.
The problem is that they do not make them.
The government partially redistributes profits by collecting taxes and paying salaries.
Mortgages are available at outrageously high interest rates.
In the strange new world of today, the modern and the pre-modern depend on each other.
Political parties are created or banned by anonymous Kremlin clerks.
Would a similar approach work for the gas in your oven?
But is it really?
This war lingered and flared well into the early Soviet era and, in 1944, the entire Chechen population was forcibly deported to Central Asia.
Russia conquered Muslim territories in the Volga-Ural area, Caucasus and Central Asia, and brutally suppressed any resistance.
With a few short-lived exceptions, Russia's imperial government did not support Orthodox evangelism.
After the Revolution, Soviet policy preserved the most important aspects of the old imperial approach.
In Spain and Sicily, Muslims were discriminated against, forcibly baptized, and expelled since the 15th century.
The policy toward the Muslims pursued by the Russian Empire, by contrast, largely preserved ethnic and religious communities.
Vampire jokes abound.
Putin thinks that his stunts are essential to governance.
All that is missing are the jowls.
And the plunge is accelerating.
The Russian financial crisis is high drama, best described as a tragedy in five acts.
Then, on August 8, Putin launched the second act of this Russian tragedy, his long-planned attack on Georgia.
Not surprisingly, foreign investors no longer favor Putin’s Russia.
Numerous medium-sized banks, and some large ones, are set to go under in the stock-market turmoil.
In the fifth act, investment will seize up.
Russian capitalism hates the consumer as much as Russian communism did.
Neither the system nor the people are to blame for this state of affairs.
Its practical borrowings are invariably stillborn, mostly because of the country's ingrained culture of contempt.
Consider Moscow, a highly seasoned imitator (though nowhere in the league of St. Petersburg, that baroque Italianate city on the Neva, as an urban mimic).
Moscow nowadays has all the trappings of high-end capitalism: Prada, Fouchon, Rolls Royce.
Some restaurants greet their customers with a guard who brusquely asks what they want, as if they came to buy stamps, not to have dinner.
But perhaps the authorities are right to want to keep us in line.
I once went for lunch to a Swedish-style buffet in Moscow.
Then came Georgia’s “Rose Revolution.”
In effect, Vneshtorgbank renationalized United Georgian Bank, but the new owner was the Russian state.
Parallel with this, Russia and Armenia are planning a new rail link to Iran.
In both cases, there is no link between inflation and interest rates.
MP’s would have read and analyzed it attentively, asked ministers many questions, and, if necessary, insisted on re-writing various tables presented in the draft.
Democracy was not invented by fools.
Experience tells us that if you don’t let the steam out of a pot, the pot will explode.
It’s a mistake.
Indeed, the threat of fascism is real.
But others are not so sure.
Those voices matter, but less every day. For an epoch in Russia's history is ending.
The impossibility of communism's restoration is perhaps the great achievement of Yeltsin's presidency.
That year was a valuable learning experience for everyone.
What Russia needs is both an economy and state civilized by law.
A limited state will emerge only if the part of society that values freedom, property and security becomes politically active.
Voters under 30 account for 29% of the total population, but only 3-5% of them vote.
Ukraine was punished in this way for its eagerness to integrate with the West following the Orange Revolution.
Ethnic Georgians living in Russia, including those who are Russian citizens, became targets of persecution.
But they are really illegal occupiers, as Russia’s decision to give Russian passports to these regions’ residents attests.
It suggested, instead, that the army should play a secondary role in anti-terrorist operations.
The Army's hostility to reform is deeply ingrained.
Whatever happens in the March 2012 presidential elections, the political mobilization of the middle class will eventually lead to democratization.
Foreign languages flooded into Russia: English, Dutch, French, and Italian.
Sometimes they add to, sometimes they replace, Russian analogues.
There was less, now we have more.
Isn't this good?
Soup; soup in general, with no variations.
Everything we eat with a spoon is soup; everything we eat with a fork is not soup.
Don't ask what ingredients are used in making those dishes.
Forget even a simple difference between the "shchi" (cabbage soup) and the "borshch" (beet soup).
Why use a name when we have a product?
Clothes, too, are now generic in today's Russia, as in China under Mao--a blue fatigue.
If we need to address them, we can simply say, "Eh!"
What do we have nowadays?
New Improved Taste."
"Blef-klub" (Bluff Club) for example is shown on "Kultura" TV.
This is what it a typical modern Russian conversation sounds like.
C: Is soup hot ?
W: Hot plus .
C: (eating) Eh ?!?!
C: Soup is not hot .
W: No?
Not hot ?
W: Well, it's one buck .

At this point your author runs away, in despair, in search of the few remaining Russians who still converse in their native language.
Russia’s Lawless Legality
He was subsequently disbarred and was himself arrested in April 2006.
Finally, consider Khodorkovsky and Lebedev themselves.
But maybe he will in the course of this trial, which resembles a personal vendetta even more than the first one did.
But, instead of buying villas, yachts, or soccer clubs abroad, he invested his fortune in Russia.
The entire Vostok 2010 exercise involved more than 20,000 troops.
Russian voters vote don't vote a party line, they vote the mass media line.
When the presidential election occurred, however, neither man was anywhere to be seen.
What happened to OVR, supposedly the new party of power?
That same mass media also created a new idol who has now swept all before him.
In the wake of Putin's personal juggernaut, Unity also lapsed into desuetude.
The other group less subject to informational hypnosis are young people.
Some 5,000 newspapers appear in Russia.
Their total combined circulation is of similar size to total newspaper circulation in Germany, but there fewer than 500 titles do the job.
Russia’s Moving Presidential Target
Russia’s somewhat archaic political culture overly personifies power.
Russia\u0027s Naked Public Space
The first such billboard showed a young woman's face, but no bar of soap or bottle of perfume. No brand name, either.
A short line said simply "I love you."
Roma found a classy place for himself."
Under Communism, public debate was confined to private kitchens.
Everything beyond private space was state territory.
Perestroika turned the country into one big public space.
Newspapers published in gigantic numbers.
Instead, political life here has been reduced to mere formality.
On the contrary, the state generally ignores its citizens - it is in no way accountable to the public, nor does it bother to explain what actually goes on inside the Kremlin.
But their print runs range between 20 and 100 thousand copies, and their circulation is mostly limited to Moscow.
Did Khodorkovsky write the letter, or had he merely signed it?
If he was the author, was it his political manifesto or an act of repentance?
A lamb, after all, does not provoke a bear.
Of course, there is nothing new in such battles.
All other attempts to shape the political atmosphere and influence events, especially by a powerful oligarch, violate this logic.
Sadly, in this clash of titans, postcommunist Russia's main values--liberty and private property--hardly get a mention.
Indeed, in the absence of political participation, the government enjoys easy dominance over society.
Both times, however, the traditional pattern of state dominance was quickly reestablished.
Stalin’s regime could be compared to a cruel, sadistic father who keeps his children in a state of fear and submission.
In big cities, moreover, anew urban class is emerging – advanced and modernized Russians with good professional skills who feel at ease in the globalized world.
Such divisions occur regularly.
Putin has appealed to Russia’s most reactionary forces by restricting gay people’s rights with legislation that Western countries abandoned years ago.
There is no doubt that chemical weapons were used to kill hundreds of civilians in the suburbs of Damascus on August 21.
The full facts have yet to be established – perhaps they will never be.
To this day, it is not known for certain who was behind the attacks.
The point is that under political systems as obscure as those in Syria – and Russia – no one knows who really controls what.
Geopolitical calculations have, naturally, played a part in these maneuvers.
Russia’s Pipeline to Empire
What he means by that is that Russia is to be “independent” of the moral and human rights concerns of the Western democracies.
As Putin shuffles his court, subordinating the Duma to his will, the EU’s hopes for a growing “Europeanization” of Russia should be abandoned.
Indeed, Matthias Warnig, the chief executive of the pipeline consortium that Schroeder will chair, is a longtime Putin friend.
As a former Head of State of newly independent Lithuania, I frequently endured such threats.
The EU has signed numerous agreements with Russia including one for a “common space” for freedom and justice.
The Kremlin is very good at feigning such idealism.
The United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, and Canada have all seen declining birth rates as well.
In Spain, the birthrate of 1.07 per woman is even lower than in Russia.
The restoration of the capital, Grozny, was one of his clear achievements.
It was suggested that a new Chechen capital be built.
So he encouraged an Islamic dress code and built a huge mosque – one of the biggest, if not the biggest, in Europe.
Russia’s Road to Isolation
Next week, Presidents Putin and Bush will meet in Slovakia.
Sergei Karaganov, Chairman of Russia’s Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, assesses Russia’s deepening foreign policy problems.
Moreover, Russia's dialogue with the European Union reached a dead end in 2004.
I could add more to this list, but that would merely be to rub salt into our wounds, which are my own as well.
But we placed amateurs in charge of dealing with Ukraine – amateurs with far-reaching commercial interests.
As our failures mount, we snarl and blame others, or construct imaginary plans for countering the great powers.
After all, this minority is one of thinkers – musicians, artists, and writers, and those who move forward Russian science, technology, and economic innovation.
But I fear that it won’t work.
He has achieved prominence in a foreign country, inventing something outstanding.
Then this scientist will be surprised (or not) to discover that the Russian majority views Joseph Stalin as the third most popular person in a contest to be known as the “Face of Russia.”
It is trying so hard to have its turn as chair of the elite Group of Eight countries taken seriously.
They see discussing “energy security” with Russia as akin to chatting about water safety with Comrade Crocodile.
Putin, however, implemented such a policy a few years ago, and the results have been nothing short of miraculous.
So perhaps Putin had better not try to push his country’s accomplishments too far.
TOMSK, SIBERIA: Europe ignores Russia’s public health problems at its peril.
The proportion is much the same throughout Western Europe.
When your house is on fire, do you suddenly decide to conserve water?
Time is short.
There are four reasons for this.
Ukrainians, on the other hand, are close to us in their culture and mentality.
So Russia now has a choice: Ukrainian plan A or Ukrainian plan B.
First, Iran’s nuclear program is now on the diplomatic front burner.
All this adds up to a Russia that, if not quite a Potemkin state, is anything but great.
But how much will it matter?
Isolating Russia makes no sense.
TOLEDO &#45;&#45; If “one man of courage makes a majority,” as Andrew Jackson said, then 30 years ago, in November 1977, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was such a man.
The gate to Israeli-Arab reconciliation remains where it was always been – in the hands of the Palestinians.
Saddam and the Arabs
They have good reason for avoiding such close scrutiny.
Saddam spent unreservedly, buying off politicians, journalists, writers, and artists in Iraq, the Arab world, and beyond.
In the Arab world many of these people are literary celebrities, film idols, and media stars.
I experienced directly the difficulty of trying to offer an alternative view of Iraq and its cultural life.
Indeed, it was Saddam who added the words "God is great" in his own handwriting to the Iraqi flag.
On a wider scale, it was meant to influence and win over Arab and Muslim minds by hollow but bombastic rhetoric.
Saddam Hussein Before the Law
What is at stake in the trial of Saddam Hussein, which is set to begin on October 19?
Can it succeed?
Safeguarding Asia’s Growth
It has already aggressively loosened monetary policy, and it can employ further fiscal stimulus.
But they cannot rule out the downside risk of a synchronized global downturn.
So what changed?
Saif Qaddafi and Me
I was first briefed by a former Monitor Company employee, who gently intimated that I should not to expect too much.
Saif himself held photocopies of pages from one of my books on which he had scribbled notes.
Saif never followed up; nor did I. But if a real invitation had come, would I have traveled to Libya, spent time with him, and possibly met his father and his cronies?
Memories of Tiananmen are still fresh.
Or what about a country like Ethiopia?
I have had intensive economic-policy discussions with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in Addis Ababa.
I must confess to having enjoyed these talks more than most meetings I have in Washington, DC and other democratic capitals.
Vietnam's long war ended 25 years ago, on April 30, 1975.
I was lucky.
That was 1968, the year of the Tet Offensive.
He spoke French with me.
Helicopters skittered on the Embassy's rooftop.
This was ‘Operation Frequent Wind,' code-name for America's evacuation from Saigon.
We learned English, managed America's raucous sounds, even as we preserved our multiple versions of the old.
Across America, in Orange County in California, in Houston and Dallas, Arlington and Falls Church, Virginia, Saigon has been resurrected.
South Vietnam's flag of yellow with three red horizontal stripes often flies side-by-side with the Star-Spangled banner.
Twenty five years after the exodus from Vietnam, a reverse exodus is taking place.
In Ho Chi Minh City, a name not even Communist officials use, Saigon remains its old brash, energetic, and audacious self.
Before 1986, it was a crime to own a private business.
What he wanted to learn was how his Mekong Delta province could attract some of the foreign investment going mostly to Saigon.
The rights of the individual were submerged by the horrors of the first half of the twentieth century.
Indeed, if the West can be said to have a public philosophy nowadays, it is a philosophy of human rights.
Only in 2004 were British gays allowed to form “civil partnerships” – relationships with the same legal status as marriage, but denied the title.
But allowing them to marry has proved a harder legislative nut to crack than allowing them civil partnerships.
But they disagree about what that core is.
The arguments on both sides have been of high quality, especially in the House of Lords.
But what counts as justification?
Since the world is a closed system, this raises the question: Who will run the world’s deficits?
This was true of Roman-Indian trade in the first and second centuries, and of the age of European exploration in the sixteenth century.
The Romans had to debase their coins, owing to the continuous loss of gold to India.
Santa Claus Speaks German
After years of stagnant growth, the German economy has been growing at an annual rate of about 2.5% in 2006.
In 2006, the euro-zone economies may have grown by 2.7% on average, and should grow by 2.2% in 2007.
However, unemployment has increased from one boom to the next, with the lowest rate in each business cycle following a linear upward trend.
The first winner is democracy.
His strategy to attract the electorates of Jean Marie Le Pen’s extreme right, proved to be a winning one.
In a classical Left-Right contest she can only lose.
The clear loser in the first round is the leader of the extreme-right Jean-Marie Le Pen.
While voters denied the UMP a landslide victory in the second round, its overall win meant that the governing party retained its legislative majority for the first time in 29 years.
But France is not a normal country.
On July 13, the leaders of more than 40 countries attended the first gathering of the “Union for the Mediterranean” in Paris.
But this is what politics is all about.
But can a man act against his deepest nature?
The euro is gaining ground for several reasons.
Sarkozy at Dusk
Uncertainty prevailed.
I can give you that.”
Sarkozy has had to confront exceptionally difficult circumstances, and his record is far from poor.
Sarkozy Chooses Dishonor
Will re-introduction of the death penalty be the next step on this populist downward spiral?
But a pure “law and order” response to these problems will not magically repair the damage inflicted by years of bad policy and neglect.
The French presidency combines both the symbols and the realities of power – the equivalent of both the Queen of England and the British prime minister.
Sarkozy Goes to War
In the eyes of the French, France’s international status remains a key ingredient in forming their own national identity.
And, just as suddenly, the French, according to early polls, are proud again to be French.
The Sarkozy factor is fundamental.
France has a common history and geography with the countries on the southern Mediterranean shore.
And today, with France taking the lead in an international effort to protect the Libyan people from their leader, they can feel simultaneously proud of being French and of their Arab roots.
Sarkozy’s Moment
They could be co-located in a regulatory Tower of Babel in Basel.
Sarkozy’s Secret Rupture
But it does mean that France will no longer oppose America just for the sake of opposing America.
Sarkozy’s Société Générale Myopia
The loss for Société Générale could have been far higher than the €5 billion it is reported to have incurred.
According to Laurent Dubois, a political science professor at the Sorbonne in Paris, Noyer may pay for Sarkozy’s battles with the European Central Bank.
That would be a good thing.
So far, the only serious candidates to emerge for a Société Générale takeover are two French banks, Credit Agricole and BNP Paribas.
The Société Générale rogue trader scandal has caused more problems than any of the main players possibly could have imagined.
Although they have mostly been on land, operation “Atlanta” off the coast of Somalia saw the EU’s first naval operation.
All were launched autonomously, relying either on national command arrangements or on making the most of command arrangements with NATO known as Berlin-plus.
Domestic pressure on the Saudi royal family, the al-Sauds, arises from widespread opposition to any war against Iraq, as well as to America’s military presence.
Making matters worse, the al-Sauds realize that American demands will persist after any war on Iraq is concluded.
But the death of Sultan, at 86, marks the beginning of a critical period of domestic and foreign uncertainty for the Kingdom.
After all, Sultan’s half-brother, King Abdullah, 87, is still hospitalized in Riyadh, following a major operation last month.
Meanwhile, the succession is still being argued.
In other words, Naif will be anointed Crown Prince.
The Al Saud resembles a family business, established in 1932.
That is no longer true of the thousands of princes that they produced.
Whereas Abdullah at least talked about reform (though with no real consequences), Naif can barely bring himself to utter the word.
And, if anyone tries, they will follow Naif’s counsel: “What we took by the sword we will hold by the sword.”
Three pilgrims died and hundreds were injured in the ensuing stampede.
Soon after, representatives of Saudi Arabia’s Shia community sought a meeting with King Abdullah in an effort to free the detainees.
The threat that this would represent is not abstract: the Kingdom’s borders are very porous.
The Iranian revolution prompted a Shia uprising in the Eastern Province in November 1979.
Saudi Arabia vs. the Arab Spring
In reality, the Kingdom’s response is centered, as its foreign and domestic policy has long been, on “stability.”
The highest council of Saudi religious scholars recently declared demonstrations to be categorically un-Islamic.
The threat of chaos, evident now in Libya, Syria, and Yemen, also weighed in the royal family’s favor.
Abruptly, some $130 billion was added to spending projections over the next five years.
King Abdullah has called the killings unacceptable, and has withdrawn his ambassador from Damascus.
In fact, the country is on the verge of total collapse.
Great change is coming to the Middle East.
Savable Africa
First, Africa does not grow enough food.
In 1965, India averaged 854 kilograms of grain per hectare in use, while Sub-Saharan Africa averaged almost the same, 773 kilograms per hectare.
But, by 2000, India was producing 2,293 kilograms per hectare, while Africa was producing only 1,118.
But, again, Africa cannot afford them.
This cost would be spread over several years.
(South Korea has been investment-grade for years.)
Economic fundamentals have fallen by the wayside. 
Emerging markets need foreign currency and, therefore, external support.
But there is no shortage of resources.
Saved by Taxes
And when economists see behavior that has destructive side effects, we like to tax it.
None of this is news.
Rising asset prices follow from this psychology.
Almost 90 per cent of total job losses have been concentrated in this age bracket.
Far too many post-mortems of the economic crisis are now being written.
Saving Face and Peace in the Gulf
But how else can the US, the EU, and the United Nations make clear that the “international community” means what it says?
Bombing for Morality
Why this particular red line?
Mao Zedong was responsible for the deaths of more than 40 million Chinese in the 1950’s and 1960’s.
The US supported him.
But where exactly do we draw that line?
How many murders constitute genocide?
Thousands?
Millions?
Or is it not a question of numbers?
Technically, killing ten people for such reasons – or even two – could be a form of genocide.
Nor is it a great power.
It is the view of most people in Europe.
It is also the view of most people in the US.
Can he incarnate France with dignity and legitimacy?
At that rate, the world economy would double in size in 14 years. 
After the upward jump in energy prices in 1973, annual global growth fell from roughly 5% between 1960 and 1973 to around 3% between 1973 and 1989.
Land is also increasingly scarce.
TEL AVIV – Revolutions throughout history have proven to devour their children.
At their meeting in Scheveningen, the Netherlands, the EU's economic ministers (Ecofin) once again confronted the need to reform the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).
Consider the proposal to link the SGP to the Lisbon agenda, which contains more than 100 indicators.
We think so.
Nobody can get through the day without using a product that comes from a forest.
Every year, we lose 14.6 million hectares (56,000 square miles) of forests – an area almost four times the area of Switzerland.
Indonesia’s Sumatra Island is a good example.
It is likely that plants not yet discovered will disappear along the way, as well as such endangered species as the Sumatran rhino and elephant, as well as the orangutan.
To make matters worse, the demand for wood for reconstruction following last year’s tsunami is intensifying the already untenable demands being placed on Sumatra’s forests.
There is no point even trying to feed tuna anything but fish. 
Farming carnivorous fish increases rather than reduces pressure on wild stocks.
The damaged part of the aorta was then replaced with a synthetic graft.
Moreover, surviving the surgery does not mean returning to one’s usual state of health in a matter of a few weeks.
In rich countries, this does not mean rationing care based on age alone.
Scarcity in an Age of Plenty
The world needs to rethink the sources of growth.
Capital gains should be taxed at least at as high a rate as ordinary income.
Scenes from the Drug War
The war on drugs takes many forms.
Impatient, she flew to Quetta to discuss with Mullah Nasim Aukhundzada a poppy substitution program.
Anyone who dreamed of the American way of life now looked stupid.
Criticism of America did not stop there.
Then came the eurozone’s sovereign-debt crisis, with its roots in lax government finance in some (mostly southern European) countries.
Critics now had a new focus.
They were not the only critics.
But such criticism captures only one small part of Europe’s difficulties.
Africa is a rich continent -- rich in bio-diversity, rich in mineral resources, rich in precious stones.
But Africa is also a poor continent.
Yet, the ultimate impact of science and technology depends on all three factors.
Science and technology cannot save Africa by themselves, but Africa without science and technology cannot be saved.
Science and the Meaning of Life
At least until now.
Living organisms obviously embody arrangements of matter into complex structures.
Above the level of individual organisms, they form societies and ecosystems.
Physics even accepts the idea that entropy defines the direction of time.
In the end everything will be broken down and randomly distributed.
In other words, life promotes disorder.
But that is not what Schneider and Sagan mean.
As one example, they consider a phenomenon of which beer drinkers have long been aware.
If you want to empty a bottle of water (or beer) and turn it upside down, the water will come out in uneven glugs.
The eddy in the bottle is a structure in the water.
The more complex the structure the more effective is the energy dissemination.
Nature just  is .
In fact, synthetic compounds may be safer than natural ones.
It is also our obligation.
Zero risk does not exist.
Risk appears with life.
Zero risk is a dead world.
We must walk the path to the tree of knowledge if we are to control our destiny. 
Here too we now have a precise, operative picture of all life processes, from bacteria to humanity.
Scientific Capitalism
And, since almost every observation that economists make turns out in a way that wasn’t predicted, no unexpected observation could ever actually change an economic paradigm.
Like boxing and poker, it is a soft, restrained, private form of warfare.
But that is not the real problem.
The world watched, seemingly helpless to do anything.
Then it will be up to governments to act.
To achieve this, viable instruments are needed.
Common threats to Europe’s energy security demand a common response.
Securing Synthetic Securities
This is a clear demonstration of how derivatives and synthetic securities were used to create imaginary value out of thin air.
Indeed, more triple-A CDOs were created than there were underlying triple-A assets.
The use of derivatives and other synthetic instruments must be regulated, even if all the parties are sophisticated investors.
It was also true of the portfolio insurance programs that caused the New York Stock Exchange’s Black Monday of October 1987.
In addition to insurance, they also provide a license to kill.
Derivatives traded on exchanges should be registered as a class.
The Senate Agriculture Committee proposes blocking deposit-taking banks from making markets in swaps.
It can bomb Somalia, Afghanistan, and Iraq, but seems ill-equipped to help these places develop.
Positive trends are also seen in Brazil and Mexico.
The biggest problem areas are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, the Andean region, and Central Asia.
But the problems in sub-Saharan Africa, the Andes, and Central Asia are not solving themselves.
The worst situation, by far, is in Africa.
The US increased foreign aid by perhaps $4 billion a year at the same time that it increased military spending by $150 billion annually and cut taxes by trillions of dollars.
Securing the Future of Energy
Oil companies still drill for and refine petroleum, and principally sell gasoline and diesel fuel.
What has happened?
It is still a useful commodity, but no one regards salt mines any more as instruments of national power and influence.
LED’s are beginning to lead the way.
Many nations can also learn a great deal from Denmark’s creative use of waste heat for cogeneration.
So what is to be done to re-establish security?
President Bush once told America's Congress that "Al Qaeda is to terror what the Mafia is to crime."
But it is impossible to behead networks, much less networks of unconditional haters.
Putin gets a pass on Chechnya.
Efforts to open the southern border of the US and the eastern border of the EU are put on the back burner.
Seeing Double at Central Banks
The carbon-trading scheme that it established gave rise to many abuses.
These efforts can serve as a prototype for assisting other countries such as Guyana, where the current forest-preservation scheme does not work so well.
In this way, carbon pricing will be introduced and international cooperation established from the bottom up, on a sectoral basis rooted in demonstrated results.
Yet we imagine science as free of unexamined cultural assumptions.
This is more or less true for some fields - say, chemistry or physics.
This rather un-Darwinian perspective so upset a British paleontologist, the late Beverly Halstead, that in 1984 he traveled to Kyoto to confront Imanishi.
A man can become a fish and a fish can become God.
They plotted kinship relationships over multiple generations, believing that primates must have a complex family life, just like us. 
If individuals learn from one another, over time their behavior may diverge from that of other groups, thus constituting a distinct culture. 
The answer lies in language.
A single language for scientific papers and conferences is clearly desirable, and the language of international science is English.
Like a Hollywood interpretation of a French novel, their origins become erased.
This question is not merely theoretical.
It is rarely put on behalf of individuals, but it regularly arises for sub-groups, such as national minorities, who see themselves as oppressed by majorities.
Such is the answer, valid or not, that people accept in democratic societies.
If identification with the community is rejected, the government will be illegitimate in the eyes of the rejecters.
In the decade or so leading up to the meltdown of 2007-2008, the global trend was toward regulatory integration.
Other countries adopted slightly different models.
The Dutch model brigaded the prudential regulators inside the central bank, while the Australian version was built on a separate institution.
Among the twin peak exponents, the Dutch system performed very poorly indeed, while Australian financial regulation may be considered a success.
For the first time, the Bank of England will supervise insurance companies as well.
A similar change has been introduced in France, where a new Prudential Control Authority has been created.
After all, financial systems are not so different from one another, particularly in OECD countries.
Christian Friis Bach’s electric-powered vehicle was incapable of covering the 30 kilometers from his house to the palace without running out of power.
Unfortunately, the story is not unique.
Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has introduced a carbon tax to “enable economic growth without increases in carbon pollution.”
Politicians in Denmark and elsewhere argue as if this were no longer true: a transition to a green economy will create millions of new “green jobs.”
Selecting Our Children
MELBOURNE – In April, Germany’s parliament placed limits on the use of genetic diagnosis.
They will invest resources in training employees whom their competitors will exclude from the initial pool of recruits.
Self and the City
Today, more than half of the world’s population lives in cities, compared to less than 3% in 1800.
Pride in one’s city has a long history.
And a city’s ethos shapes more than its leaders.
Or consider Montreal, whose residents must navigate the city’s tricky linguistic politics.
Hong Kong is a special case, where the capitalist way of life is so central that it is enshrined in the constitution (the Basic Law).
Paris, on the other hand, has a romantic ethos.
Urban pride – what we call “civicism” – is a key feature of our identities today.
Information is power, and today a much larger part of the world’s population has access to it.
The US government spends 450 times more on hard military power than on soft power.
But now prices on the broad index of the S&P 500 stood at 29 times the average of the past decade's earnings.
We can point to three factors, each of which can take roughly one-third of the credit for annual real returns of 6%, rather than zero, over the past decade:
As J.P. Morgan put it when asked to predict what stock prices would do, “They will fluctuate.”
Send in the Clowns
He is also one of Italy’s most influential political commentators.
Until a few years ago, the one TV program most Mexicans turned to for political information was called The Morning Quickie, broadcast from 6-10 a.m.
Nero was a murderer who understood that he had to amuse the masses to gain popular support.
In the US, especially, the borderlines between showbiz and politics (or indeed religion) have always been porous.
People don’t trust the professionals.
Senegal’s Democracy Put to the Test
In fact, secularism in Senegal resembles that in India more than anywhere else.
Some parents still elect to send their children to private, often Franco-Arabic, schools.
Yet, despite all these positive developments, Senegal’s unusual democracy is imperiled.
But Wade postponed legislative elections, originally scheduled for June 2006, first to February 2007, and later, by presidential decree, to June 2007.
A month before the election, only 64% of citizens who had registered had received their voting cards.
None of this was shown on television.
So Senegal’s “rituals of respect” may not be holding.
That is terrible for Senegal and Africa, as well as for America’s credibility.
But Senegal’s democracy hangs in the balance.
East Asia’s Patriots and Populists
The treaty demarcated territory, including Takeshima.
Here, history has a story to tell as well.
Japan’s government officially incorporated the Senkaku Islands into Japanese national territory in 1895.
But the nationalist genie, once released, is not easily controlled.
What France and Germany achieved in the 1950’s can serve as an example.
Let’s go back to basics.
But is it proportional?
Most people would say that doing so is permissible, even though the harm to the aggressor is much greater than the value of the victim’s teeth.
This is a matter of constant debate.
But let us suppose that the British bombed Buenos Aires.
But this is not as clear as it is in domestic criminal law.
There are two reasons why international law is tolerant of the use of all, or nearly all, necessary force.
The United States Navy surely had the right to defend itself--if it could--before the bombs fell.
Is this not akin to a mugger pointing a gun at your head and threatening to shoot?
What is good for the goose must be good for the gander.
Actually people are merely sacks of meat on sticks.
But it is a magical assertion.
It is holding such truths to be self-evident that first makes them so – and more specifically, doing so in concert, alongside others.
Theirs is a labor, of course, that remains far short of completion.
Take the case of Maria Victoria Fallon, a lawyer in Medellin, capital of Colombia’s most violent state.
Since its formation in 1987, five of her group’s presidents have been gunned down.
Unless she left Medellin within 24 hours, it told her, she too would be killed.
"Please pay attention," the voice continued.
"This is no joke."
Maria Victoria left Medellin the next day, though for only a few weeks.
But holding such truths is magical.
Separatism, Italian-Style
From the 1960’s onwards, bombs and death were the order of the day in regions like Northern Ireland, Corsica (France), South Tyrol (Italy), and the Basque country (Spain).
Indeed, the specter of violent separatism has reared its head again in Spain.
Zaia’s vivid imagination does not stop there: he has now proposed that popular Italian TV series be dubbed or subtitled in the local dialect!
Others groups want to remain part of Russia.
Take the case of Byelorussia.
These bind us together.
Byelorussia’s President Aleksander Lukashenka seeks closer ties to Russia.
Crimean Tartars, for example, want to return home to their “Crimea.”
Individuals should be able to return to their homelands, but as individuals.
September 11, 2002
For those born afterward "that absence was dismissed before they were born.
They do not remember the world without it."
Today, it is a contingency that must be accounted for in every trip to the airport.
This is not only a matter of heightened security.
Here lies the difference between September 11, 2001 and September 11, 2002.
We will not wait for another version of this lesson.
Looking back a year, we see how the future has changed.
Serbia\u0027s Choice
It is the spiritual essence of “celestial Serbia,” the site of its most important Orthodox churches, and therefore far from being just a piece of territory.
PARIS – In early November, the Russian government released its latest macroeconomic forecast.
For independent observers, the ministry’s grim forecast comes as no surprise.
Such cases are legion.
That is only one example.
The Directive brings the protections for human subjects in European clinical trials in line with those in the US.
Yet many institutions and investigators have a financial stake in the clinical trials they conduct.
However, there is no likelihood of passage anytime soon.
Serious Negotiations or Hot Confrontation with Iran?
Moreover, the proportion of the population engaged in farming will tend to fall, since fewer farmers are needed to feed the entire country.
By 2010, the proportions were roughly 2%, 17%, and 81%, respectively.
Sure, the blackboard gave way to an overhead projector, and then to PowerPoint; but, otherwise, the basic classroom “production system” seemed to change little.
Now information technology is coming to the rescue.
Serving Two Masters
All they needed to do was boost the stock price, then cash in their option.
Set the IMF Free
For these analytical functions, there is no need for close oversight.
On the contrary, independence and professional expertise should be decisive.
Set the Universities Free
In the case of higher education, there is of course an alternative.
To some extent this has happened in Europe.
All these methods have their problems.
But what is the alternative?
More than ever, the American system is regarded as a model.
Public and private contributions are combined in many ways.
Seven More Years of Hard Times?
So we have to be historically oriented in our method.
They used to refer to Japan’s “lost decade.”
So, there are many more than just two modern cases (though they are not all entirely independent, because they are somewhat bunched in time).
How did this happen?
That is a historical pattern.
Seven Years in Afghanistan
Our children are back in school.
The war on terrorism cannot be fought in Afghan villages.
Bridges have been blown up, soldiers and police killed.
The violence has spread to India as well, with bombings in Gujarat, Bangalore, and Delhi.
Pakistan’s new president, Asif Ali Zardari, has suffered from terrorism as we have suffered.
He has a son who works in the Afghan Foreign Office.
A viable future means security as well as bread.
Our Debt to Stalingrad
We are not created fresh in an unmarked Eden under a new sun.
Our past has built up layer upon layer of instincts, propensities, habits of thought, patterns of interaction, and material resources.
On top of this historical foundation, we build our civilization.
Seventy-nine years ago, Germany went mad.
The criminals are almost all dead now.
Seventy years ago, 200,000 Soviet soldiers –&nbsp;overwhelmingly male and predominantly Russian – crossed the Volga River to the city of Stalingrad.
For five months, they fought.
And perhaps 80% of them died in the ruins of the city.
They went on to spring the trap of Operation Uranus, the code name for the planned encirclement and annihilation of the German Sixth Army and Fourth Panzer Army.
May there never be another such battle.
Today’s Italian Catholic political leaders often embrace such a lifestyle.
Despite his lack of muscles and hair, Berlusconi is the embodiment of this form of success.
That has now changed.
Sex and Surveillance
In the 1950’s, communism and the homosexual “threat” became wedded in the American public imagination.
Think about your own privacy and secrets.
Why is there culture?
What motivates people to write poems, paint, or sing?
They are therefore sexually attractive.
Likewise, the amateur painter does not increase her or his attractiveness much compared to a van Gogh or a Picasso.
The same goes for writers.
Sport is in this respect also a form of culture, albeit one that is often sneered at by those engaged in pursuits like classical music or serious literature.
Here, of course, it’s only the best that become local or national heroes.
Following this reasoning, what makes the poet, the painter, and the singer attractive is uselessness combined with the difficulty of their activity.
The mechanism works all the same.
The poet, painter, and singer may think they do what they do for more high-minded reasons, but scientists know otherwise.
Hey, science is hard, too!
Shades of Gray
In other words, one in a thousand voted for them, although they claimed to speak for that state’s retired and elderly people – over 30% of the population.
Many more “Greys” voted for the Greens than for their “own” party.
This is an important fact.
A plethora of magazines tell pensioners what they can do.
Advice ranges from sex in old age to tourism.
Tourism, in particular – cruises as well as more adventurous trips – has become a favorite pastime for the elderly.
For many of them, life seems to become an almost permanent holiday.
Old people who have families are often found in a new role as educators of the young.
Like the unemployed, they do not want a political party devoted to their plight.
But the broad conclusion remains: wealth is conditional on services.
Rewarding success is acceptable; rewarding failure is not.
In such situations, the great advantage of democracies is that they allow a change of rulers without a change of regime.
Deepening economic recession is bound to catalyze political change.
The Western democracies will survive with only modest changes.
The big countries with the highest political risk are Russia and China.
Shaping the Post-Carbon Economy
Italy and Germany were nineteenth-century amalgamations of a colorful variety of small and medium-size political units.
But, once Germany was united, Bavarians did not like the outcome, and then thought of a united Europe as a counterweight to the German state.
The United States’ early history was dominated by a passionate debate about the issue of solidarity.
Setting the clock back would thus not simply return Europe to the mid-twentieth century.
If we take a worldwide perspective, it clearly did.
Now, it is less than one in four.
But the prospects for a continuing reduction in world poverty in 2009 are not good.
All of this causes real suffering.
In the US, 97% of those classified by the Census Bureau as poor own a color TV and a car.
They will struggle to feed their families.
In this dire situation, what will the rich countries do?
Sharm el-Sheikh Redux
Former chief of staff and defense minister Shaul Mufaz provides the security expertise.
OPEC calculates member countries' quotas based on proven reserves.
Moreover, Shell also operates a joint venture partnership between the NNPC, the French oil company Elf, and Agip of Italy.
Indeed, Shell insists that Nigeria owes it $385 million more.
Shifting the Afghan “Great Game”
China is also engaged in constructing a $500 million electric plant and railway link between Tajikistan and Pakistan.
But to what extent can “Abenomics” claim credit?
But Abe has two more arrows in his policy quiver.
Further investments in research and education are likely to pay high dividends.
Japan in Action
Abe is resolved to make steady progress on each of these key issues.
Shinzo Abe’s Grand Arrival
The same is true of antidepressants. 
Where are the protests about the one-year-olds being treated with antipsychotic drugs?
Shorting Fiscal Consolidation
One just doesn’t know.
Long-term inflation-indexed bond yields have fallen to around 1% a year, or less, in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the eurozone.
Elsewhere, yields have been a little higher – around 2% in Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand – but still very low by historical standards.
Unlike the EU, African unity cannot be built on the will of the elites alone;
Should Children Take Antidepressants?
But whatever the outcome, it is urgent that doubts about the safety of these drugs are resolved.
Should China be “Contained”?
They are wrong.
In 1800, Asia represented half the world’s population and half the world’s economy.
It has its own internal balance of power.
It is as if Mexico and Canada sought an alliance with China to balance US power in North America.
Should Europe Regulate Sovereign Wealth Funds?
WIESBADEN – State-controlled investments from overseas – so-called sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) – are now the subject of intense debate.
Among the first countries to invest their considerable state-owned funds were Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Norway, and Singapore.
They invested, and still invest, their budgetary surpluses worldwide in government bonds and state-owned enterprises.
In the UAE, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has estimated capital assets of $875 billion, making it probably the world’s largest state-owned investment company.
The Kuwait Investment Authority, also a state-owned fund, holds 7% of Daimler.
Both funds are invested worldwide, including with the port operator PSA.
Most investments are seen to benefit a country’s economy, if not its security.
We in Germany need to distinguish one from the other.
Since 1988, the US president can prohibit foreign direct investment if it is seen as a threat to national security.
Should Iran Be Attacked?
Would an Iranian bomb really be so bad?
But one is tempted to believe them when they add that they are now focused on diplomacy.
The story takes place in France, in Belgium, and in Luxemburg.
Arcelor, originally French and Luxemburguese but now predominantly Belgian, has a strong base in Brazil and operates throughout much of the world.
It specializes in high-quality, special steel products designed for the most complicated uses.
Mittal, by contrast, is a conglomerate that has come out of nowhere to become the world’s leading steel company in a mere two decades.
It did so by brilliantly consolidating and rationalizing steel plants throughout the world.
Its president is Indian, but it has no factory in India.
Mittal won.
This choice directly concerns more than 150,000 employees.
Indeed, in reality, the company is a community of men and women who draw their incomes from the same economic and technical venture.
This is nonsense.
I argued that things would not get better until they got much worse, and that the collapse of one of the world’s largest financial firms was imminent.
Should the Troops Come Home Now?
Each of these tasks is formidable.
Hands Off Syria?
Such a government would have to be representative and coherent.
And Western powers would need to be sure that their weapons would not fall into potentially unfriendly hands.
It may come to that.
The US Supreme Court became the guardian of affirmative action.
Second, is equal representation at all levels really what all groups want or need?
Many countries have benefited from the entrepreneurialism of their Chinese or Jewish minorities.
Are we perhaps pursuing too mechanical an ideal which confuses the absence of privilege and disadvantage with the absence of diversity?
Should We Talk About Race and Intelligence?
Watson tried to clarify his remarks in a subsequent interview in The Independent, saying:
It may well be.
But simply wanting this to be the case is not enough.
This is not science.
A racist has a negative attitude to people of a particular race.
There is nothing racist about trying to learn what the facts are.
That is precisely what Watson has now admitted he did.
Rockefeller University also cancelled a lecture that Watson had been scheduled to give.
Is the question too sensitive for science to explore?
Some say that the tools we use to measure intelligence – IQ tests – are themselves culturally biased.
Controlling for these variables is difficult.
In one dilemma, you are standing by a railroad track when you notice that a trolley, with no one aboard, is heading for a group of five people.
When asked what you should do in these circumstances, most people say that you should divert the trolley onto the side track, thus saving a net four lives.
In another dilemma, the trolley, as before, is about to kill five people.
This time, however, you are not standing near the track, but on a footbridge above the track.
This judgment is not limited to particular cultures.
Blowing up people with bombs is no better than clubbing them to death.
So we should think for ourselves, not just listen to our intuitions.
Showdown in Bali
(With Australia’s new government now having signed the Protocol, America is now the sole holdout among the advanced industrial countries.)
The timing of the conference is not propitious.
Better incentives must be part of the solution.
Of course, polluting industries like the cap-and-trade system.
But the world today is different from the world of 25 years ago, or even 10 years ago.
Hope Amid the Middle East’s Turmoil
Egypt hovers on the brink.
Now is a time not for despair, but for active engagement.
But the democrats are not giving up.
It is now clear that the status quo in the region will not hold.
The discussion about religion’s role in government and society is now out in the open.
The Israeli-Palestinian issue is crucial for all the obvious reasons.
This is the lesson that we should bear in mind as Syria disintegrates before our eyes.
But the Chinese policy elite are also very taken with the idea that a first-rank country needs a prominent banking system that is active internationally.
China is like Cinderella – finally allowed to attend the ball and given a chance to become a prominent player.
Clinicians are not alone in studying ketamine’s potential.
But not a shot has been fired across Sinai.
Sinai residents claim that there were no funerals following the missile strikes.
Single Financial Regulators Are the Future
Norway, Denmark and Sweden led the way here, but many others soon followed, or announced an intention to do so. 
Second, economies of scale and scope are available to an integrated regulator.
· the desirability of facilitation of innovation in connection with regulated activities; 
Sink or Swim in the Philippines
Of prime concern is the fact that sea travel has been and will always be perilous.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that Philippine law places a very low value on human life.
Indeed, in Philippine courts, the cost of indemnity for a human life is valued at only $2,500.
All of this explains why Sulpicio Lines, the owner of the Princess of the Stars, has remained in commercial operations despite its many lapses.
To many of them, sea travel remains the only viable means of transportation.
Non-seaworthy vessels notwithstanding, their only alternative would be to swim – or, like those on board the Princess of the Stars, to sink.
Sinking the Sunshine Policy
Last week's naval battle between North and South Korean warships sank more than a South Korean frigate.
So the trend is worrying.
Sixty Years of the Palestinian “Catastrophe”
But the international community, Palestinians, and Arabs all bear responsibility as well, albeit at different levels.
Who are we kidding?
His long-term policy seems clear: to place his Serb entity, Republika Srpska, in a position to secede if the opportunity arises.
The US, lame duck president or not, must re-engage.
·         More than six million workers have been unemployed for more than six months, and four million for over a year;
The country now has an unemployment problem that is large in magnitude and increasingly structural in nature.
This is much more than a problem for the here and now.
This is a crisis.
And insufficient attention has been devoted to maintaining an adequate social safety net.
It will undermine labor’s skills and productivity.
As everyone who has ever had an unpalatable job knows, shutting off the alarm and pulling the blanket over one’s head is not a solution.
The rise of the MMA is sure to make a fundamental change upon not only Pakistani foreign policy but also upon the country's society and culture.
Folk singers have been threatened, abducted, and forbidden to sing in public.
This has led to aggressive US Army sweeps, backed in some cases by heavy bombers.
Fighting terror backed by radical Islam requires a sophisticated understanding of its political and economic roots.
And it could have happened again.
What has gone wrong?
Then again, given Europe's experience with revolution--in both the East and the West--perhaps that apathy should be welcomed.
Slumdog Oscar
Slum life is depicted with integrity and dignity, and with a joie de vivre that transcends its setting.
And, if some of the film’s larger-than-expected profits are directed toward the slums where the movie was made, the protestors are quite likely to fade away.
What they want, after all, is a share of the glory.
Slumdog Millionaire is the work of an artist at the peak of his powers.
WASHINGTON, DC – Greece’s GDP, at about $300 billion, represents approximately 0.5% of world output.
So, at least on paper, Greece should not be a systemically important economy.
One can find other examples of this kind.
As these examples indicate, however, systemic importance is not just a question of size.
This will help expose foreign investors to listed companies at home and local investors to companies abroad.
For the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchange, where I work, and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange--Africa's two largest--the agenda is clear.
This is not the only reason why looking more closely at energy and carbon taxes makes sense.
But this debate can be just as heated.
Cambridge University Press is publishing their research and findings this month, under the title Smart Solutions to Climate Change.
In fact, this estimate is wildly optimistic.
The reason is simple.
Surveillance and American Liberty
In that sense, security surveillance can benefit both the US and other countries.
After all, part of the plot that culminated in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, was hatched by an Egyptian living in Hamburg.
Most interesting was the split in both parties.
Social Democracy Lives in Latin America
In Brazil, Chile and Uruguay, social democracy is proving that it can work.
The Frente Amplio (FA) brings together nearly all the country’s left-wing groups and has the loyal support of labor unions. 
Socialism or Global Division?
To be sure, we have very diverse societies, but we also face new forms of inequality.
Environmental concerns have become a “blame game.”
In PASOK, the Greek Socialist party that I lead, we are undertaking far-reaching reforms in this direction.
The point is reinforced by a curious glossy magazine advertisement that you might have seen recently.
It is for expensive luggage.
Mikhail Gorbachev sits in the back of a limousine.
He is being driven past the Berlin Wall.
On the seat next to him is the luxury brand, a leather attaché case.
The message?
So the economy is the big story.
This year it is monks in Tibet.
The history is complicated.
But I have no problem in accepting that Tibet is part of China.
The Dalai Lama is not a devious terrorist.
They devised the “one country, two systems” formula for Hong Kong.
It is good news for everyone.
The other big global political story is the American presidential election.
He treated the issue head-on, and intelligently.
So why is all of this – Tibet on the one hand and American soft power on the other – so significant?
It’s simple.
This is not a balance-of-power gladiatorial contest.
Does the world want and need Leninism with its shopping malls?
Or does the world want the sort of freedom that embraces politics as well as economics?
Secretary Powell replied that the US had used hard power to win World War II, but he continued: "What followed immediately after hard power?
After the war in Iraq ended, I spoke about soft power (a concept I developed) to a conference co-sponsored by the US Army in Washington.
But power, defined as the ability to influence others, comes in many guises, and soft power is not weakness.
It is based on culture, political ideals, and policies.
Hard power, which relies on coercion, grows out of military and economic might.
The US is more powerful than any country since the Roman Empire, but like Rome, America is neither invincible nor invulnerable.
Only hard power can deal with them.
But the overall health of Polish democracy is another matter.
Hopeless people do not vote.
Second, one of the necessary conditions of a functioning democracy are clear and sufficiently distinct party political programs.
That is not the case in Poland.
People in those countries had the sense that they could understand their neighbors and fellow citizens, and that they shared a close link with them.
These are not people who came from outside their countries.
We live, today, in uncharted territory.
But that is true of any kind of dismissive view of the “other.”
The death toll is expected to exceed 15,000.
Japan has done its part.
Note to editors of on-line editions:
Somalia’s Endless Hell
MOGADISHU &#45;&#45; Somalia’s internal conflict is propelled by a combustible mix of religion, politics, and clan rivalry.
According to the most recent United Nations figures, 400,000 people, or roughly one-third of Mogadishu’s population, have fled the city.
Since last December, Somalia has been in a de facto state of civil war.
Ignoring the situation in Somalia and not trying to reestablish law and order is not an option.
The two main factions fighting in Mogadishu are backed, respectively, by Ethiopia and Eritrea.
These include poverty, tribalism, and the failure of the country to live up to the vision of its first president, Jomo Kenyatta.
PARIS – National repentance is in the news again, as it has been with remarkable frequency in recent years.
Repentance is not a sign of weakness.
So who’s right in this debate which has spilled into the streets of Seattle, Washington, and now Prague, during the cycle of international economics meetings in the past year?
First, some countries are heavily burdened by their physical geography.
For them, globalization is not a curse, but it is hardly a solution.
But free trade is not enough.
Soulless Bodies
The world’s leading scholar in artificial intelligence once described people as machines made of meat.
We do not feel, after all, that we are just material bodies, mere flesh.
Instead, we occupy our bodies.
We own them.
The philosopher Peter Singer discusses the notion of a moral circle – the circle of things that matter to us, that have moral significance.
People, after all, are made of meat.
They become soulless bodies, and the moral circle closes in to exclude them.
When Descartes crossed the Holland Sea, he kept the doll in a small trunk in his cabin.
There is no consensus as to precisely how mental life emerges from a physical brain, but there is no doubt that this is its source.
South Asia at War
Moreover, they wanted payback for India’s role in supporting the revolt in the 1960’s and 1970’s that led to Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan.
According to Indian investigators, this group is implicated in the Mumbai attacks.
The G-7 was small enough to be workable, but too small to claim legitimacy.
Europe could be represented by both the United Kingdom and the eurozone.
In Seoul, South Korea must be there as the host.
The ninth country could be any of the rest.
But occasionally such meetings are important, in ways that are often not clear until later.
Consider the London G-20 meeting in 2009.
TOKYO – This is a year of presidential elections worldwide, and the last to take place – on December 19 – will be in South Korea.
But the election may well have a more positive impact on the region as a whole.
But it is Park who has so far stimulated the greatest interest.
For many South Koreans, Park is a tragic heroine.
Both her mother and her father, President Park Chung-hee, were assassinated, in 1974 and 1979, respectively.
She has also served as a leader of the Saenuri Party (formerly known as the Grand National Party).
But now the real battle begins.
If elected, Park will become South Korea’s first female president.
In 2000, only 5.9% of the National Assembly’s 299 members were women.
Ordinary Koreans insist that US soldiers who commit crimes should be tried in Korean courts.
Indeed, at the beginning of the twentieth century, such efforts failed and Korea became a colony of Japan.
South Korea ranked 9th in hard power resources but performed more poorly in terms of soft power.
For example, in the past two decades, Norway, a country of only five million people, has taken a lead in peace talks.
Finally, there is the attractiveness of South Korean culture.
The traditions of Korean art, crafts, and cuisine have already spread around the world.
Southeast Asia’s Pakistan Problem
Regional leaders understand this.
A year ago at their Cebu (Philippines) summit, the leaders of ASEAN adopted the “ASEAN Convention Against Terrorism.”
Southeast Asia’s Widening Arms Race
Malaysia has agreed to buy 18 Su-30MKM’s over the next two years, while Vietnam has purchased 36 SU-27SK’s, 12 of which are already in service.
It is no overstatement to say that those efforts, which boosted trade and investment in the region, formed the foundation of Japan’s national power today.
Sovereignty Bound
I am not against the institution of the State as such.
This value is humanity.
The State serves the people, not the other way round.
If a person serves his or her state such service should go only as far as is necessary for the state to do a good service to all its citizens.
Each of us has some specific interests.
But there is something that ranks higher than our interests: it is the principles that we espouse.
Principles unite rather than divide; they are the yardsticks for measuring the legitimacy of our interests.
Principles must be respected and upheld for their own sake; interests should be derived from them.
Observers today tend to forget that, until the early 1980’s, Spain qualified as a developing country, according to World Bank standards.
The foundations of Spain’s current labor laws date to 1938, when the civil war was tearing the country apart.
Paradoxically, the bulk of this platform has survived as a banner of the left.
Indeed, Santander and BBVA rank among today’s most successful international banks.
Spain’s soccer victory was not a fluke but the culmination of a long evolution to emerge as a winning machine from its Francoist furia española past.
BARCELONA: Espańa va bien (Spain is doing well).
That phrase is on everyone’s tongue nowadays.
All this activity has put Madrid back on the map, not only as a force in the global marketplace but in diplomacy too.
Liberalization, accompanied by economic growth, is the engine for this overseas expansion.
Introducing real competition in energy and telecoms, lacking in the privatization process until now, is also pledged.
Cross-shareholdings that reinforce monopoly power will be strictly limited in these sectors as well.
Without improved research and development (R&D), the gap between Spain and the world leaders will grow.
Participation of Catalonia in Spain’s modernization project would probably be guaranteed if Barcelona were to become, effectively, the second capital of Spain.
Spanish Leadership for Europe’s Roma
Up to 12 million Roma live in Europe today, primarily in the East.
I speak with some authority on this subject.
Just a year ago, the United States had five major freestanding investment banks that stood atop its mighty financial sector.
MANNHEIM – The European Union’s policy of saving the euro at all costs is enough to guarantee the euro’s survival.
Likewise, the rift between the eurozone’s 17 members and the other ten EU countries is widening.
And unemployment hovers above 10%, with youth unemployment far higher, at roughly 25%.
Indeed, its ranking on the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index fell from 18th last year to 21st this year (Germany ranked sixth both years).
Spying on Eros
What do these two issues have in common?
Indicators and correlations are easier to demonstrate.
During the Cold War, Western intelligence agencies developed an immense catalogue of indicators and correlations.
If train traffic on certain routes increased, it suggested that army food supplies were being delivered, thus hinting at impending military action.
Once the Soviets realized this, they began to send bogus shipments around the country on random schedules, creating shortages for the baffled civilian population.
Yes, it is true.
Spies are interested in prurient behavior everywhere.
But local tastes nonetheless vary widely.
Squaring Asia’s Nuclear Triangle
Taiwan has three nuclear power plants, and, like the plant at Fukushima, they directly face the ocean.
Now the day of reckoning looms.
That game is up.
Like Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, membership in the euro denies Italy and Spain devaluation and inflation as policy tools.
But that is neither the majority view, nor the view reflected by the markets.
Stalin, Our Contemporary
In a violent and massive campaign of “collectivization,” he brought Soviet agriculture under state control. 
Yet Soviet citizens resisted in large numbers; Kazakh nomads fled to China, Ukrainian farmers to Poland.
Yet control is not creation.
It proved impossible to make Central Asian nomads into productive farmers in a single growing season.
In Ukraine, the harvest failed in 1931.
Each November, Ukrainians commemorate the victims of 1933.
Lukashenko is running for a fourth consecutive presidential term in December.
Controlling the land, he also controls the vote.
Stalin Lives
Some see the hand of what remains of the Communist Party behind this.
Of course, towns and cities are no longer named for Stalin.
Yeltsin understood this.
Eight years ago the remains of the Romanov family were publicly buried in the Peter-Paul castle in Saint Petersburg.
People of the older generation do, of course, remember the hardships of the 1930’s and 1940’s.
Today, Russians listen to old Soviet songs and watch Soviet-era movies.
It could not even subdue Chechnya, a small republic within the Russian federation.
Needless to say, Stalin’s name will be mentioned countless times during these celebrations.
Standards for Non-Standard Monetary Policy
During the financial crisis, market functioning was impaired, at times very profoundly.
Starving for Capital in Sub-Saharan Africa
China recovered $56 billion between 1989 and 1991.
This threat, together with terrorist attacks in Kenya, Tanzania, Tunisia, and Morocco, has prompted the Bush administration to install military bases in the region.
The Court’s members can choose to do so at any time in the future.
September is traditionally the time when opera companies and orchestras return to their home cities from Aix, Salzburg, Tanglewood, and countless other summer festivals.
This rentrée is also marked (on both sides of the Atlantic) by the return of worries about how classical music is financed.
But cheap prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny problem of access for youth.
First, youth may not take advantage of cheap tickets to the extent that they are not interested in going to hear live classical music at any price.
What good are cheap prices, which serve mainly to subsidize the same subscription holders, if there are no seats?
If a taste for classical music is to be subsidized, some more targeted subsidies should be preferred to cheap prices.
The best way to bring youth to the performing arts is through education.
This type of innovative program is relevant for European as well as American orchestras.
The problem of youth and access to the performing arts exists on both sides of the Atlantic.
If orchestras don’t look after their own futures, they may well not have one to look after.
At this point, the road forward is fraught with peril and uncertainty.
The on-again, off-again talks on North Korea can fluster even the most experienced of negotiators.
These are just a few of the issues that will complicate US relations with North Korea and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
The choice is now Obama’s.
Stem Cell Obscurantism
Step in, Prodi!
Too quick, alas.
When Austria’s new coalition government was sworn in, the boycotts ensued.
The new Austrian government was judged by its European partners without being able to "submit its observations" as stated in the Treaty.
Everybody is confused: which set of common values have been broken by the Austrians?
Does Europe have one set of rules for small countries and another for big ones?
Do we have one set of rules for the extreme right and one for the extreme left?
I don’t want to shake your hand; I don’t want to sit beside you; I won’t listen when you talk….
This is not a dignified way to act. The big question is: can this situation be reversed?
This arrangement fits America’s needs like a glove.
Its 12th Five-Year Plan, enacted in March 2011, lays out a broad framework for a more balanced growth model that relies increasingly on domestic private consumption.
The time has come for China to respond with equal clarity.
For China, this is not a power race.
China just happens to have understood this first.
Diet and Growth
This takes an enormous toll.
That starts with strong leadership in countries where the challenge is acute.
At the same time, ensuring that these efforts translate into better health outcomes requires a revolution in the way families prepare their children’s food.
The British medical journal The Lancet has described a package of effective interventions to accomplish this.
For us, this means working closely with our neighbors in the East African Community.
Stick to the Resolution
To clarify the issues, the best place to start is with the two UN Security Council resolutions.
But that is politics.
This should be one of the central themes of the next G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh.
This decline reflects the wage cap on social security taxes (currently at $102,000).
Cash transfers, like social security and unemployment insurance, are highly equalizing.
Educational expenditures are allocated on the basis of the number of schoolchildren in the family.
Collective goods like fire and police protection are allocated on a per capita basis.
Government spending, no less than government transfers, has actual beneficiaries.
Stock Markets’ Fear of Falling
In June, the index dropped more than 1% on four days, and gained more than 1% on two days.
Going back further, there was a gigantic one-day drop on February 27, 2007, of 3.5%, and no sharp rebound.
The February 27 drop in US stock prices was only the 31st biggest one-day drop since 1950.
People still talk about October 28, 1929, or October 19, 1987.
Stocks and the Long Run
Do the math.
At the moment, the yield-to-maturity of the ten-year US Treasury bond is 3.76%.
Some of that money will be paid out in dividends.
But aren’t stocks risky?
We also had the long slide from 1977-1982 that followed a 40% collapse from 1973-1975.
Before that, we had declines in 1946-1949, 1937-1942, and the biggest of them all in 1929-1933.
This is especially true when there is a chance to save or make money.
Indeed, the OSCE treats the Lukashenka-controlled parliament in the same way it does any EU parliament.
So real parliaments and sham parliaments are treated as equals.
The idea would be laughable if it were not so tragic.
The goal is not to ensure Europe’s democratic purity, but to change the nature of Belarus’s government.
That won’t be easy.
Indeed, Belarus’s last independent daily newspaper recently went out of business.
Israel should withdraw from all Lebanese territory, including Shebaa Farms, and release the Lebanese prisoners.
The general parameters of a long-term, two-state agreement are well known.
Stopping Latin America’s Budding Arms Race
Even Chile, after a lengthy process of weighing its options, is still pondering whether to acquire a dozen American-built jet fighters or a joint Swedish-Brazilian alternative.
Today the situation is more complex.
In Brazil, matters are somewhat different.
But will the Euro last? 
Story Time for the World Economy
Or the reverse?
The new movie Star Trek , based on yet another remake of a television show from more than 40 years ago, surprised everyone by raking in $76.5 million on its first weekend.
Strangers in the Land?
Migration is the side of globalization that, to borrow Oscar Wilde's phrase, dare not speak its name.
Euro Lessons for East Asia
Most promising is the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) of the ASEAN+3 – the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus China, Japan, and South Korea.
The $240 billion fund is small, amounting to only about 1.5% of the region’s GDP.
The International Monetary Fund provides one of the most important tools.
The new approach to exchange rate policies represents one of the most significant advances.
The IMF offers that venue.
This is the very essence of international cooperation.
Strengthening Labor Standards in the Global Workplace
Securing Nuclear Material
That’s the good news.
The risk of nuclear or other radioactive material falling into the wrong hands is all too real.
Some material goes missing and is never found.
The smugglers had tried to evade detection by building a shielded container – a worrisome level of sophistication on their part.
They had also shared information with their counterparts in other countries.
These locations are generally not as well protected as nuclear facilities.
Each metal had its different coinage.
These would be the silver currencies.
Meanwhile, the euro would be the equivalent of the gold standard.
So they stepped up investment in new facilities, new customers and new employees.
Stumbling in the Dark
The event’s popularity is not hard to fathom.
Therein lies the big problem with Earth Hour.
In Africa, this will not be possible until a new breed of genuinely public-spirited leaders emerges.
However, it is understandable that plans under current discussion envision focusing first on the youngest and oldest workers.
The members have established an SCO-Afghan Working Group to provide a coordinating mechanism for the large number of SCO initiatives that concern Afghanistan.
This collaboration should be expanded, because China and Russia, perhaps more than any other countries, share common interests with the West in Afghanistan.
In addition, Chinese officials remain concerned about the Taliban’s ties with Islamic extremist groups advocating independence for China’s restive Xinjiang region.
The contract also involves the construction of a power plant and a railroad connecting the mines to China through Pakistan.
Sudan and Africa’s Future
On January 9, 2011, the people of South Sudan will vote in a referendum to decide whether they will remain part of a united Sudan or form a new independent state.
The Sudan is the biggest country in Africa.
Common frontiers mean common ethnic origins, common cultures, and shared ways of life and environmental conditions.
A turbulent and unstable Sudan would not therefore be a catalyst of peace and stability in Africa, and vice versa.”
Sudan between Peril and Hope
ALGIERS – The future of Sudan hangs in the balance.
Sudan’s political leaders are backtracking on the commitments under the peace agreement.
We dare not let this happen.
After all, Sudan is not a small, insignificant country; it is the tenth largest – the biggest in Africa and in the Arab world.
It occupies a pivotal position on our continent, bordering Egypt to the north and Kenya to the south, as well as seven other countries.
The country’s complex and inter-linked problems cannot be tackled in a piecemeal fashion.
Summertime Blues
And in the first week of August 2007, IKB Deutsche Industriebank disintegrated, as the US subprime crisis spread.
The explanation at that time was usually found in the predictable timing of the international payments mechanism.
Indeed, this was the Urkrise – the event that made the twentieth century so terrible.
Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo on June 28, but the subsequent diplomatic discussions dragged out for weeks.
Most of the cells in our bodies have a short life span and a specific job to do.
Stem cells, found in many organs from skin to bone marrow, are different.
The “ancestors” of ordinary cells, they can replenish themselves indefinitely.
We owe it to those who are in need to explore all possible avenues that could lead to medical cures.
The Global Economy on the Fly
ISTANBUL – In the last four weeks, I have traveled to Sofia, Kuala Lumpur, Dubai, London, Milan, Frankfurt, Berlin, Paris, Beijing, Tokyo, Istanbul, and throughout the United States.
Then there is the Middle East, which remains an arc of instability from the Maghreb to Pakistan.
Children of all ages will give flowers, make breakfast, call home.
In some countries, one woman in eight will die giving birth.
They give birth at home, perhaps with the help of a midwife who most likely has no medical training.
I myself was born at home, in a small village in the Korean countryside.
Yet we still have very far to go.
Every year, hundreds of thousands of women die in childbirth, 99% of them in developing countries.
In other words, don’t jump into the water unless you can swim.
In other words, everyone really should learn to swim.
This capital has to be invested somewhere.
Trinidad – Sustainability has become the foundation for almost all economic thinking nowadays.
Factoring sustainability into all our thinking is necessary because, as a global society, we are living on the edge.
I have seen shrinking glaciers in Antarctica and the Andes.
I have seen the effects of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon and the loss of biodiversity.
The very existence of some Caribbean countries, including portions of Trinidad and Tobago, could be threatened if sea levels rise.
By tackling climate change, we also deal with the economic crisis — green jobs for green growth.
Sustainable Cities
Manhattan’s density is approximately 67,000 people per square mile, or more than 800 times that of the US as a whole and roughly 30 times that of Los Angeles.
Their households also use much less electricity: 4,696 kilowatt hours per year, compared with 16,116 kilowatt hours in Dallas, Texas.
Well, yes.
And for the same reasons.
The world’s population is expected to reach nine billion by 2042.
If we are to sustain a world of that size, growth must occur almost entirely in cities.
All those new highways, in combination with India’s brand-new “People’s Car,” the $2,500 Tata Nano, represent an environmental, economic, and cultural disaster in the making.
The Future Global Economy
It means expanding access to credit and financial services everywhere.
These can be termed the economic, social, and environmental pillars of sustainable development, or, more simply, the “triple bottom line” of sustainable development.
We currently move around 1,000 to 2,000 kilograms of machinery to transport only one or just a few people, each weighing perhaps 75 kilograms (165 lbs.).
Sustainable Medicine
Politics surely plays a role.
When we  do get it, we quickly raise the bar, wanting still more.
But unlimited progress cannot be paid for with finite funds.
Why is obesity increasing almost everywhere?
Why is it so difficult to persuade contemporary people to exercise?
Medicine must shift its focus from length of life to quality of life.
A medicine that keeps people alive too long is not a decent and humane medicine.
Medicine needs an analogous insight.
STOCKHOLM – Although Sweden is a small country, its experiences managing its financial crisis of the early 1990’s may provide valuable lessons for others. 
But if the US follows the Swedish pattern, the worst of the financial sector’s problems are now in the past.
And achieving that goal is more important than ever, because it will be some time before the US can re-assume the role of locomotive for the world economy.
Sweden’s Other Rape Suspects
Lindberg also served as the Police Academy’s spokesman against sexual violence.
We have been here before.
Sweden’s Shame
VIENNA – Last month, firecrackers were thrown at the only synagogue in the Swedish city of Malmö, breaking three windows.
Two weeks previously, another attack was launched against the same synagogue.
Anti-Semitism is back, and what is taking place in Malmö is merely an extreme manifestation of what is happening across the whole of Sweden.
Swine Flu for Grownups
Will it keep spreading, or will it fizzle?
Will it retreat during the northern hemisphere’s summer and return in the fall?
1. Don’t feign confidence. Nobody likes uncertainty; we all wish the experts knew exactly what will happen.
3. Don’t worry about panic. Panic is rare in emergencies.
Such disdainful communication further reduces trust.
Sympathy for Greenspan
But what is the natural level?
Those who fear a jihadi takeover cite recent events in Sinai.
The other school of thought does not take this scenario lightly.
In June, Obama announced that Assad’s regime had used chemical weapons against its own population and had thus crossed his administration’s “red line.”
But no coherent action or policy followed this powerful statement.
Through his confident performance, the new President gained in stature.
Syria’s Dangerous Liaisons
All eyes turned to Syria following the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
Syria’s Sectarian Stalemate
Moreover, neither Syria’s neighbors nor Western governments are willing to intervene militarily.
So even the Lion of Damascus ("Assad" means lion in Arabic), it appears, is no longer willing to isolate himself from changes in the region.
In short: Syria has no military option.
Here again the disappearance of Soviet power brings our Syria’s vulnerability.
So both sides labor under complex conditions and in political contexts which make negotiations an almost Byzantine game.
First came the scandal of leaked (actually hacked) e-mails at the climate institute of Britain’s East Anglia University.
Between 1995 and 1999, he chaired a working group on Himalayan Glaciology within the International Commission on Snow and Ice.
But, the retreat of a glacier’s “snout” is only one of three measures of how glaciers can change.
The Himalayan glaciers have not stopped losing mass, although they are losing it at a somewhat slower rate than before.
The same study also shows that smaller glaciers are shrinking much more rapidly than larger ones.
While glaciers that cover more than five square kilometers have lost 12% of their mass, those under one square kilometer have lost 38 percent.
Taiwan and China, At It Again
But, there is another dynamic at work.
This leaves unification as the last tie to Mao's revolution and justification for one-party rule.
How can such a scenario be realized?
For its part, Taiwan needs to calm down.
Mao's advice is not bad.
What blocks matrimony is China's lack of democracy.
Only democracy in China can bring lasting peace to the Taiwan Straits.
Opposition street protests and shouts that the assassination was stage followed.
With so much at stake, both camps mobilized millions of people.
The DPP is a relatively young party, formed only in 1986.
Its victory has now made it a fixture on the political landscape.
Yet this should not be considered an outright victory for Taiwanese nationalism.
Of course, Taiwan under President Ma still wants the same rights that it desired under Chen.
But Ma has taken a different approach.
China’s leaders find his language inoffensive.
This has allowed Ma’s administration to claim credit for improving relations with China.
For example, acknowledgement of Scotland’s right to choose independence has not resulted in Scotland leaving the United Kingdom.
Ma has created the necessary conditions for deactivating the trigger.
The damage they will do will likely weaken the US and add instability to the world economy.
Both President George Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton had to raise taxes to clean up the Reagan-era mess.
Those tax increases probably contributed to President Bush Sr's defeat by Bill Clinton in 1992.
In Hungary, non-residents hold 20% of government securities and account for 70% of the equity market's capitalization.
Foreign owners--mostly EU-based banks--now control roughly 95% of assets in the Czech and Slovak banking sectors.
The difficulties in determining cause and effect must be acknowledged.
One problem is that the consequences for neglecting drug safety are non-existing or minimal.
Package inserts in fine print are useless;
Such an office exists in the United Kingdom.
Other governments should follow this model in order to fulfill their neglected role as guardian of public health.
Taking Faith Seriously
One thing is certain: the influence of religion and faith in determining the outcome.
I don’t mean the politics of religion, but religion as religion.
In particular, their economies need to reform, open up, and grow in order to meet their citizens’ rising expectations.
Egypt’s population was around 30 million in the 1950’s; today it is 90 million.
And the new political masters need to know that if they don’t succeed, it is the right of the people to vote them out.
One face is about service to others; the other face does not accept them.
Education has a vital role to play.
And have we in the West any real appreciation of the true nature of the Hindu or Buddhist faith?
This is a key question of our time.
But the Classical Greeks had natural philosophy, and the Classical Romans believed in figuring out what worked and applying it.
That really special thing had three parts.
And British government scientists predict that the United Kingdom will be “a predominantly obese society” by 2050.
Moreover, there would be less hunger in a de-carbonized world.
That is precisely what we are now aiming to do.
For any other infectious disease or global health threat, achieving this kind of reduction in incidence rate and mortality would be nothing short of miraculous.
That is why we now need the Integrated Global Action Plan.
The first has just begun.
The negotiations were difficult. They promise to become even more so.
The future of the planet is at stake.
Above all, we need to think boldly and freshly.
And that means that these expenditures must be  investments .
We stand on the threshold of a new multilateralism.
This week, the London School of Economics and Oxford University are publishing their conclusions.
The group points out that it makes no sense to compare climate change to other environmental challenges that we have faced and solved.
If any – or all – of this sounds familiar, it may be because I have been arguing much the same points for some time.
After all, capitalism is practically a synonym for speculation, isn’t it?
Blinder is absolutely right that the problem could get worse.
According to Blinder, governments should encourage education for jobs that are harder to outsource overseas.
Taming Bigotry
But his opponent was Nigerian-born, and the remark was a racist insult.
A famous player of the 1990’s said at the time, “I’d make a racist comment every week if I thought it would help win the game.”
And spectators were no different: “Of course, I sing out ‘black bastard,’ but I don’t mean it.
And all of this was happening in a country that seemed, institutionally at least, to have put its racist past behind it.
But sport was somehow different.
That mood and behavior began to change with the action of a star Aboriginal Australian Rules footballer, Nicky Winmar, one of the very few then playing in the top professional league.
In 1993, he had had enough.
The declaration was unequivocal: “I’m black, and I’m proud of it.”
For an Australian of my generation, that is a very new, and hugely welcome, experience.
So deficits grow.
What is true for a family is not true for a country.
The same is true across the Atlantic.
Yet monetary policy is not a unique species of economic policymaking.
Taming Russia\u0027s Presidency
MOSCOW: The good news is that Russia's parliamentary elections took place.
Still, our democracy is alive; it lives on.
Taming the Private Equity “Locusts”
One part of the financial markets not subject to the transparency and disclosure rules that apply to, say, banks and mutual funds, are hedge and private equity funds.
In Britain, the Automobile Association was bought by private equity in 2004.
In Denmark, the telecommunications company TDC was taken over by a group of private equity firms in 2005, with 80% of the purchase financed by borrowing.
The European Parliament’s Socialist Group, the UK’s House of Commons, and the Australian parliament have all investigated these private funds.
Charlie McCreevy, the EU’s internal market commissioner, is staunchly resisting any move towards greater control of private equity and hedge funds.
Ultimately, private funds should be regulated globally.
The will to act exists in the EU.
The latter clearly falls within the EU’s competence.
Such discretion is both unnecessary and undesirable.
By removing that possibility, we would substantially enhance the benefits of equity-based compensation for the performance of firms – and for their shareholders.
Taming the Tigers
But fighting the Tigers and seeking a peace deal have never been alternatives.
Though the Tigers can no longer destroy Sri Lanka’s democracy, fighting to the last guerrilla is in nobody's interest.
On the most basic level, it will almost certainly require security guarantees for the Tigers’ leaders.
Sri Lanka is a democracy.
One cannot succeed without the other.
Sri Lanka’s economy must open up –�not an easy thing to achieve at a time when liberal economic reforms appear to be in disrepute.
The wall, of course, will never be built.
Consider São Paulo, the world's fourth largest city and my home.
Our past and present is the future for many others.
Of the world's six billion people, more than 50% live in cities and towns.
Even in a country as big as Brazil, over 80% of the population lives in urban areas.
In 1975, only 38% of the world's population lived in cities; by 1998, the rate had grown to 47%.
By 2015, the number will reach or exceed 55%.
In 1975, only 100 cities topped one million in population; by 2015, 527 cities will exceed that mark.
More critically, while there were only two "mega cities" with populations over 10 million in 1960, and 18 now, some 26 will exist in 2015.
Eventually, the southern hemisphere's more dramatic urban problems will spill over into mass migration to northern cities.
Surrounding these islands, however, are oceans of excluded people.
New York City stands out as a very big island with a small ocean, while in Mumbai, we find a tiny island and a vast ocean.
In other words, they have to purchase virtual land from the city.
These changes are meant to eventually benefit income distribution and to improve the quality of life for all of São Paulo's residents.
Taming Traffic
Pedestrians shouldn't have to compete with cars.
City and government officials should ensure that parks and paved paths become as ubiquitous to a city's landcape as parking spaces.
People need to walk to be happy.
A bird can survive inside a small cage and even lay eggs and bear descendants.
We, too, could live out our lives in the confines of an apartment.
We are exuberant if offered an esplanade cleared of cars, noise and pollutants.
For thousands of years, city streets were pedestrian, even if shared with horses and carriages.
Paintings up to the end of the 19th century depict cityscapes with people all about the street.
But there could be: if the Third World frees its feet, its mind will follow.
There is no mystery about what is going on.
If so, it is better to do it transparently, unlike the Bank of England.
The basic excise tax has been fixed at 16% of the value of a firm's output.
Goods taxed at high rates (for example, polished granite) are sold as goods taxed at lower rates (for example, as unpolished granite).
Collections of direct taxes also suffer.
With notable exceptions, they are found in legal and economic writings on tax policy.
Tax the Oligarchs
Another relates to economics.
The reason is simple.
It would not eliminate huge inequalities. It would not create a new middle class.
Taxing the Israeli Occupation
Yet this policy earned Europe neither recognition nor relevance.
In plain English, an “occupation tax” is needed.
They are right; an occupation cannot be sustained without the systematic violation of human rights.
Taxing Tissue
Charitable trust model .
Contract model. Tissue can be removed only with donors’ prior consent.
Patients suffering from rare disorders have adopted this approach.
Tea Time in America
That was a grave mistake.
In early February, the United States National Academy of Engineering released a report on “Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st Century.”
The National Academy of Engineering identified some possible answers.
Moreover, public policies will have to promote the testing and improvement of this technology, especially when used at a large scale. 
Moreover, this kind of technology will be useful only if it is widely used, notably in China and India.
This will be an exciting time to be a scientist or engineer facing the challenges of sustainable development.      
Technology and Economic Growth
The reason why the Federal Reserve is studying the electric dynamo is, obviously, not the Fed's interest in history.
The story of the electrical dynamo is extremely timely, and so it is perhaps no accident that Alan Greenspan has been studying it so carefully.
Technology and Inequality
But it does not have to be that way.
I disagree.
Finally, in 1997, the IBM computer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Gary Kasparov in a short match.
Isn’t the computer world champion, they asked?
Many parents see chess as an attractive alternative to mindless video games.
NEW HAVEN – The China doubters are back in force.
They seem to come in waves – every few years, or so.
Strategy.
Commitment.
China’s commitment to stability has teeth.
Enterprise and financial-market reforms have been key, and many more reforms are coming.
Over the past 30 years, the urban share of the Chinese population has risen from 20% to 46%.
According to OECD estimates, another 316 million people should move from the countryside to China’s cities over the next 20 years.
Services account for just 43% of Chinese GDP – well below global norms.
Modern China has long been a magnet for global multinational corporations seeking both efficiency and a toehold in the world’s most populous market.
Such investments provide China with access to modern technologies and management systems – a catalyst to economic development.
Education.
This is not a time to bet against China.
(By contrast, reconstruction in Iraqi Kurdistan is occurring at breakneck speed.)
Ten Years after the Mouse Roared
Al Qaeda killed more Americans on 9/11 than the attack by the government of Japan did at Pearl Harbor in 1941.
This might be called the “privatization of war.”
Russia controlled great force, but it could not acquire power over the US from its arsenal.
The Sino-American Decade
Each will account for approximately 15% of global output.
Thanks to our achievements, we are receiving more and more calls to help in a crisis or after a war.
The EU was ahead of its time in 1999.
In 2004, Operation Althea took over from the NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Of these 23 missions, six have been military and the other 17 civilian.
The EU is not a military alliance.
Terror Or Reform In The Greater Middle East
Agreement is uncertain.
Concern with the region did not begin with the attacks in the US in September 2001 or with the Madrid bombings.
Already in the 1980's and 1990's, Europe had launched the "Barcelona Process" to promote democracy, security and development in the region.
· Get America's role right. As with postwar European integration, America has a crucial role to play.
The terrorism that we have come to associate with Al Qaeda is special in many ways.
It is aimed at what used to be called the West, that is, a liberal order of things, a free world.
Violence born from such sources is difficult to fight.
Given a globalized movement of fury, this is not simple.
Terrorism aimed at the destruction of the liberal order is a test of that order.
Any response must be basically constructive.
Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism Reconsidered
There is also the steady drumbeat of terrorist violence in Iraq – violence that risks pushing the country into full-scale civil war.
It may reflect the ouster of the government of Afghanistan and the elimination of al-Qaida’s safe haven there.
Wars have beginnings and ends.
None of these characteristics apply here.
Office buildings and commuter trains and coffee shops are today’s battlefields.
And there is no end in sight.
Arab and Muslim leaders need to make this clear, be it in public pronouncements by politicians, lectures by teachers, or fatwas by leading clerics.
But terrorism also needs to be stripped of its motivation.
Testing Medicine
But awareness that principles of evidence-based medicine should also guide health policy has been slower to take root.
Thailand on the Precipice
BANGKOK – The two-month siege of downtown Bangkok by the so-called “Red Shirts” has ended in bloodshed.
The Thai government had no choice but to use force after negotiations with the protestors broke down.
Both outlets ran live broadcasts throughout the protest, showing all the drama that the cameras could capture.
After all, the sense of disenfranchisement among voters in the country’s populous north and northeast, as well as among the urban poor, is real.
So the ruling elite engineered a coup to secure the power they had failed to win at the ballot box.
After more than three years, Thailand’s crisis has become a knotty saga.
The rigidly hierarchical forces of the establishment are insecure and fearful of what will happen after the king dies.
Many thousands of Web sites challenging establishment interests and deploring post-coup machinations have been blocked.
Thaksin’s appeal splits the reds.
BANKOK: The arrival of Thaksin Shinawatra and his Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party into power last year supposedly marked a new day in Thai politics.
But, by absorbing some of the old fixers into TRT, Thaksin also absorbed a lobby antagonistic to reform.
Each group represents a different generation with different attitudes.
Since then, serious political commentary has disappeared from radio and TV.
The threat he now faces is that those who once ardently believed in his revolution will rebel against him.
The traditional Bangkok elites had always thought of him as an uncouth upstart.
Some of these projects were the proverbial bridges to nowhere.
In 2007, Thailand was ranked 54th, compared to first and second place for Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively.
Taiwan was ranked 25th and Korea 41st.
Or he can let history judge him even more harshly.
The choice is his.
It was, after all, formed from the remains of Thaksin’s Thai Rak Thai party, which was disbanded after the coup.
Now, add to all this a soccer team.
Thaksin’s ownership of the Manchester City football club might not seem of great importance to observers outside Thailand and Asia.
But Thais are soccer enthusiasts and even bigger fans of the English Premier League.
This, in turn, gives him a substantial popularity dividend to add to his store.
It was not for nothing that he had two Man City players accompany him on his return to Thailand.
Given the opportunity to vote, voters turned to a party not unlike Thaksin’s pre-coup Thai Rak Thai.
So why not complete the picture?
The situation is all the more uncertain in view of a problem facing the PPP.
Why is the job so important?
Alan Greenspan is a great man, but it is a curious set of circumstances that has elevated the job of Fed chairman to Mount Olympus.
Against Bush’s vapid boosterism was set Greenspan’s vast knowledge and experience.
It could have been a disaster.
That 70’s Show in Russia
Such institutions are difficult to build in every society.
But there are no magic recipes for modernization.
Moreover, there is no need to reinvent the wheel.
By contrast, the “70-80” scenario seems increasingly likely.
What the US and many other countries need is an independent, competent, and experienced body that leans neither right nor left.
This is not a matter only for the world’s largest economies.
Democracy can and should be better than that.
Thatcher and the Big Bang
Indeed, one issue that has come under the microscope is Thatcher’s reforms of the City of London in the late 1980’s.
In 1986, her government was instrumental in what is known colloquially as the “Big Bang.”
How justified is this charge?
The Financial Services Act of 1986 put an end to the pure self-regulation regime.
Thatcher was referring specifically to the dangers of fixed exchange rates, and can certainly not be counted as one of the principal architects of the so-called “efficient markets hypothesis.”
So, in the financial arena, as elsewhere, there is light and shade in the Thatcher inheritance.
The $200 Trillion Question
The lower the price of risk, the higher the price of risky assets.
At the end of 2000, at the height of the Internet stock boom and just before the 2001 crash, the economists James Glassman and Kevin Hassett published Dow 36,000 .
To my mind, though, the greatest risk is geopolitical instability.
Forget MIT.
Desperate for more education, this fall she plans to attend graduate school for computer science – in China, not America.
The Chinese are no strangers to Rwanda.
According to Chris Lundh, the American chief of Rwandatel, “That’s the way things work in Africa now.
The Chinese do it all.”
One big change is in education.
Samuel Huntington did alert us to the danger.
A year remains before us.
Most importantly, European statesmen, who know in their hearts what is required, must show the courage and the wisdom to lead.
The “New” Iraq Insurgency
Sun Tzu, the great Chinese philosopher of war, once wrote, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.”
To some degree, the Iraq insurgency reflects its historic predecessors.
Moreover, it is likely to be a protracted performance.
Its cultural context differs from twentieth-century insurgencies, particularly the use of a radical ideology derived from religion.
Multiple insurgencies co-exist in time and space, each with differing objectives and tactics.
The various components, and the subdivisions within them, do not appear to be centrally commanded.
Some may cooperate; others do not.
There are ominous indications that the relative forbearance of this group may end.
The US grew rapidly in the 1950’s and 1960’s with a relatively heavily regulated banking system.
China was becoming too big.
The “Rational” Suicide Bomber
In fact, there are basically two categories of suicide bombers.
Since the mid-1990’s, African economies have been recording growth rates that are higher than world averages.
Growth rates this year and in 2006 are projected at 4.7% and 5.2%, respectively.
Consider Ethiopia.
Africa as a continent has the world’s second highest measure of income concentration.
The “What If?” of 1989
The rest is history.
Accident has always shaped human destiny.
The Communists, not the people, would have done it.
Instead of a unified Germany today, could there still be two Germanys, East and West?
Television spotlights illuminated its broken surface, scrawled with grafitti.
The Globalization of Justice
The 70% Solution
According to Smith,
We could even wish them immortal...”
To Begin, Arafat in Beirut was Hitler in his Berlin bunker.
A Year of Reckoning for France and Europe
PARIS – France is at a crossroads.
Fiscal consolidation is the second pillar of France’s economic strategy.
Then came the crash of 2008.
So the crisis keeps growing.
But we are at an inflection point.
The division between debtor and creditor countries will become permanent, with Germany dominating and the periphery becoming a depressed hinterland.
The Achievement Myth
Go, girl!
Right on, sister!
New data in the West reveal that we have not necessarily raised a generation of daughters who are exuding self-respect and self-esteem.
Should Western feminism deepen its definition of a successful woman’s life, so that more than credentials can demonstrate well-made choices?
Finally, for reasons of history, geography, and culture, Iran’s role in Afghanistan cannot and should not be ignored.
Some now argue that large-scale engagement in Afghanistan was a mistake.
Fortunately, this is possible.
This is becoming particularly relevant today, as the smell of war hangs over Iran.
The Age of the Judge
In Federalist No. 78, he wrote that the executive commands ``the power of the sword,'' thus the instrument of legitimate violence.
Is this right?
Is there a case for a pendulum swing back to the more political powers, notably the legislature?
I believe that such a swing is necessary.
This is relevant for the current debate about reforms in many democratic countries.
The Agony and Ecstasy of Synthetic Drugs
NEW YORK – The world is speeding up.
The shift is also due to a strong supply push from increasingly aggressive criminal groups with tentacles around the world.
The ingredients for meth, for example, are readily available, recipes are easy to obtain, and batches of the drug can be cooked up in a kitchen.
Organized crime is taking over all aspects of this illicit trade, from smuggling precursor chemicals to manufacturing and trafficking the drugs.
Increasingly sophisticated labs are being discovered in, for example, Indonesia and Malaysia.
In 2007 alone, 75 ATS laboratories were seized in China.
When one lab is shut, another opens.
When one type of precursor chemical is unavailable, producers switch to an alternative.
What America Wants in Egypt
To pursue this course, however, will require standing up to Israel and Saudi Arabia.
Al Jazeera not only provided live interviews and broadcasts from the field; it introduced live debate to the Arab world.
In fact, the pressures only added to the station’s popularity among Arab viewers.
Senior US officials publicly vilified the station.
But the more the US and authoritarian Arab regimes attacked the station, the more the station became a reflector of some of the radical Islamic trends.
The Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation and Egypt’s Dream have also won large segments of the general Arab public with entertainment programs.
The Allure of Asia
It is home to three of the top twenty-five multinational brand names (Toyota, Honda, and Sony).
Japan’s global cultural influence grew in areas ranging from fashion, food, and pop music to consumer electronics, architecture, and art.
Pokemon cartoons are broadcast in 65 countries, and Japanese animation is a huge hit with filmmakers and teenagers everywhere.
But there are limits.
The Chinese film “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” became the highest grossing non-English film, and Indian movies like “Monsoon Wedding” were global box-office successes.
Indeed, “Bollywood” produces more movies every year than Hollywood.
The list goes on.
Yao Ming, the Chinese star of the National Basketball Association’s Houston Rockets, could become another Michael Jordan, and China is set to host the 2008 Summer Olympics.
All of them have it wrong.
That is not the case.
Nor does it have Soviet-style ideological appeal.
The US went to war in Iraq on the basis of Bush’s gut instincts and religious convictions, not rigorous evidence.
They reject geological evidence of climate change because they reject the science of geology itself.
The problem is an aggressive fundamentalism that denies modern science, and an aggressive anti-intellectualism that views experts and scientists as the enemy.
What is happening in the US, for example, is not happening in Europe, but it is of course characteristic of some parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.
They have replaced the young couple of five years ago – he with the hedge fund, she with interior decorators – in a McMansion in Westchester County.
Ronald Reagan asserted in 1980 that it was “morning in America,” but in America now, it is the morning after.
The American Leader We Need
LONDON – Around the world, America’s presidential election campaign has attracted as much attention as domestic political controversies in each of our own countries.
Yes, we are witnessing the emergence of China, Brazil, and India as important global economic players.
Yes, we have watched the humiliating fall of Wall Street’s masters of the universe.
A new American president would do well to remember the disastrous consequences of protectionism in the 1920’s and 1930’s.
The United Nations is far from perfect.
The American Mirror
Probably.
So 2004 is unlikely to see a repeat of the capital flight that hit Mexico in 1995 or East Asia in 1997-98.
International trade was disrupted.
Income and wealth inequalities worsened.
Consumers have better access to credit.
And, sensing all of this, companies are beginning to deploy the massive precautionary cash balances that they have accumulated.
Oil prices are not helping.
America’s full recovery is not yet guaranteed.
The American Way of Debt
But no country can accumulate debt forever - and what cannot last sooner or later must end.
The outcome was a sudden fall in the value of the dollar, which depreciated by 50% against the Deutschemark.
Europe should not welcome a sequel.
Americans and Europeans worked the same number of hours in the early 1970's.
The American World Turned Upside Down
What has happened to them?
The British, too, seem to be regarding the French with some perplexity.
The spectacular inversion of the French and US roles on the issue of intervention has different causes.
At the crossroads of this question stands NATO, an organization perceived as American by Europeans and international (i.e., not American) by the average US citizen.
NEWPORT BEACH – The sense of uncertainty prevailing in the West is palpable, and rightly so.
Thousands of people have taken to the streets of US cities, and thousands of others in Europe, to demand a fairer system.
This uncertainty extends beyond countries and regions.
Faced with this reality, different countries will opt for different de-leveraging options.
De-leveraging is closely linked to the second variable – namely, economic growth.
This leads to the final variable, the role of politicians and policymakers.
Yes, there will still be volatility, unusual strains, and historically odd outcomes.
The Anatomy of Sarkozy
Possibly.
He likes to point out that most French young people want to go to the US, and has even been nicknamed "Sarkozy the American."
But first he must overcome his own residual tendency to expect too much from an overburdened state.
The Anatomy of Slow Recovery
And it is not out of line with the experience of other rich economies, whether Japan or in Europe.
So it is easy to reassemble the puzzle.
We have seen this process at work in many other historical episodes as well – in 1870, 1890, 1929, and 2000.
Then the crash comes.
And when it does, risk tolerance collapses: everybody knows that there are immense unrealized losses in financial assets and nobody is sure that they know where they are.
What happened to the seed?
Small farmers, predominantly in developing countries, will bear the brunt of climate change.
But answers to this problem are close to hand.
In addition, crop diversification has reduced the need for costly and environmentally damaging pesticides.
That was an essential distinction.
Not if you are engaged in a serious war on terrorism."
Even powerful America cannot hunt down everyone everywhere who employs violence as a political weapon.
True, Al Qaeda's tentacles reach into many conflicts.
This argues for targeting such support, not lumping all of these groups together.
In the "war on terror," it is now the attacker who is confused.
The fight against Al Qaeda continues and must continue.
The Apocalyptic Mind
Apocalyptic beliefs have always been part of the Christian tradition.
Circles close to the Bush administration, it is rumored, take current distempers like terrorism as confirmation of biblical prophecies.
But political messianism was an offshoot of nineteenth-century optimism.
With the collapse of optimism, contemporary apocalyptic belief lays more stress on catastrophe and less on utopia.
The subtext was familiar: those who live by technology will die by it.
At some “tipping point,” the world will be subject to floods and pestilence in classic apocalyptic fashion.
How do the Chinese feel about their newfound materialism?
Do they have an intellectual structure with which to make sense of it?
The best antidote to the doom merchants is skepticism.
The Arab Drama
There is no single narrative that makes sense of this all.
There is certainly a degree of envy for what others have accomplished and a sense of desperation about how Al Qaeda can capitalize on this change.
Indeed, the EU is their natural partner in this endeavor.
Christianity is not at war with Islam.
All three, however, are incompatible with a certain interpretation which claims that the scripture is the basis upon which to build a state.”
But now things are strikingly different.
The Arab Spring’s Balance Sheet
The region’s entire value system – a political culture forged by autocracy – is being transformed.
Arab youth have rescued the Arab world from this fate.
Other countries in the region, and beyond, should embrace the Arab Spring.
The Arab Springtime of Nations?
In Iraq, the emergence of a de facto Kurdish autonomous region in the north has put an end to Saddam Hussein’s centralized Arab-controlled state.
With South Sudan’s independence,the rest of Arab-dominated Sudan could face further division, with Darfur leaving next.
And developments in Syria will undoubtedly have an impact on neighboring Lebanon.
The end of communist autocracies in the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and even Czechoslovakia brought about a dramatic wave of state creation.
· borders that have strong national and international recognition;
· agreement on who are its citizens;
· a government that rules from within the national territory;
· an elected government responsible to its citizens;
Lebanon has had regular elections since its civil war ended in 1990.
The only two Arab countries ever to recognize Israel were Egypt in 1978 and Jordan in 1994.
But this was an asymmetrical peace.
The Arab World’s Silent Feminist Revolution
To top it off, throughout the Middle East (as well as Sub-Saharan Africa and most of South Asia), rapid population growth is fueling enormous demographic pressures.
This surge is all the more remarkable given that Egypt is a desert country, its inhabitants packed along the Nile.
Cairo has become a sprawling region of some 20 million people living cheek-by-jowl with inadequate infrastructure.
They don’t protest much, but many end up in prison.
The world’s labor markets are now interconnected.
That is a tall order.
The Arabs Look Inward
Meanwhile, supporters of the former Ba'athist regime in Iraq and others are now busy defending the same old totalitarian mindset.
The remnants of Saddam's army were not pursued within Iraq, allowing him to crush the popular insurrection staged in the south, and remain in power.
Shame at the price the Iraqi people have paid for the false face of the Baathist regime can be detected everywhere.
That, in a nutshell, is the problem that both Asia and the West face in China, and which has been demonstrated once again at the G20 summit in Canada.
China interpreted that crisis as symbolizing both the decline of the Anglo-American brand of capitalism and the weakening of American economic power.
The Art of Finance
PRINCETON – In the middle of September’s financial meltdown, a remarkable event occurred in London.
Renaissance Florence depended on the patronage of the Medici.
Sixteenth-century Venice turned the wealth of the spice trade into the canvases of Titian and Tintoretto. 
Naïve outsiders found the world of contemporary art bewildering.
In part, because the art involved was far from being unintelligible.
But there was also another motive driving the bidders.
Art also functions as a store of value.
But in order to be sure of the reliability of this function, the purchaser must be convinced of the long-term valuation of the object of desire.
They saw their acquisitions of paintings and sculptures as a connection to eternity.
Who can say the same for the products of Damien Hirst?
But the story is repeated across the border in Pakistan, with serious consequences for both countries.
And Europe cannot hope to achieve its aims with technical programs alone.
To create a framework for US-European cooperation, work needs to begin now.
And who better to launch this than Nicolas Sarkozy?
Everyone knows of the dangers posed by instability on the Afghan-Pakistan border, in Pakistan and the region.
The Asian Crisis Ten Years After
The Atlantic Divide In Black and White
Relations between Continental Western Europe and the US have never been so strained in recent decades as they are now.
Is the cause a short-run disagreement about a specific issue, the war in Iraq?
Indeed, outside of universities, it scarcely ruffled American life.
The Autism Generation
SAN DIEGO – Not long ago, autism was among the rarest of disorders, afflicting only one child in every 2,000-5,000.
What is causing this epidemic and where are we headed?
Parents are now fearful that every delay in speech or socialization presages autism.
This has been the most popular theory, but it, too, is a small factor, at best.
Environmental toxins do not usually just pop out of nowhere to make a condition 100 times more common than it was less than 20 years before.
Their symptoms will not have changed – just the label.
The Autumn of the Commandante
Consider the Soviet Union.
On March 9, 1953, from the Gulf of Finland to the Bering Sea, everything stood still; likewise in Warsaw, Budapest, Prague, and East Berlin.
In Beijing, Mao Zedong himself bowed low before an immense effigy of Joseph Stalin.
The death of Marshal Josip Broz Tito brought forth an outpouring of another sort.
The Communist Party, of course, remains in power, and Mao’s portrait still looms over Tiananmen Square.
That difference matters.
So what will become of Cuba after Fidel departs?
Many observers portray Raúl Castro, Fidel’s younger brother and designated heir, as a pragmatist – the “practical Castro.”
But for now, younger communist officials, like Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque, remain ideological hardliners whom many Cubans refer to as “los Taliban.”
Ultimately, divine authority trumps political authority.
Khamenei will likely create a new faction to compete with traditional conservatives after Ahmadinejad’s decline.
One possible candidate is Said Jalili, Iran’s current nuclear negotiator, or someone like him.
But these are not the only factors.
Sure enough, right on schedule, each of those steps was set in motion in Iran, within the space of a week.
The Bad Society
Judging by pre-recession standards, a great deal of it, especially in the United States and Britain.
Getting rich was what the “new economy” was all about.
This must be wrong for moral and even practical reasons.
The Bailout Bias
Such terms provoke fear that, once confidence in any one country is lost, all others are in danger.
But financial markets, even when agitated, are not blind.
There has been surprisingly little comparative analysis of the effects of quantitative easing (QE) in Japan, the US, and Britain.
The Balkans on Trial
The death of Slobodan Milosevic has just been followed by Montenegro’s referendum on independence.
We may regret that Milosevic’s own trial ended without a conclusion.
I have always been convinced that Milosevic should have been put on trial in Belgrade.
The relatively small turnout at his funeral confirmed that only a minority of Serbs considers him a national hero.
They deserve it.
The connection is no accident.
Prisons herd together angry, unruly people against their will.
Central Banking’s New Face
But that does not necessarily imply constancy.
As a result, many central bankers have become household names; some even have tabloid nicknames, like “super Mario” Draghi.
The same disaster movie is now playing in the eurozone.
He died in 1877.
Of course, regulators cannot easily require all banks to be “well-run” in Bagehot’s sense.
Unfortunately, there is no such institute, in Baltimore or anywhere else.
Both can’t be right.
One shortcoming of the measure consists in the fact that the crisis has hit both universal and specialized banks.
Concentration in well-defined deposit and loan markets is linked with competitive pressure.
I disagree.
Perhaps this proximity was at the root of the IMF’s failure to interpret the evidence right under its nose.
The Battle for Bahrain
The rest are Shia.
Each of these groups is making different, if not contradictory, demands.
Political instability is a way of life in Bahrain.
NEW YORK – The election of the United States’ next president is surely the most important contest in the democratic world.
Consider, for instance, the question of Winston Churchill’s bust.
A bronze sculpture of the British prime minister had been in the Oval Office of the White House since the 1960’s.
He talked about “the British race” or the “English-speaking peoples.”
And, like British empire-builders in the past, US elites often claim a moral mission to remake the world in America’s image.
Too much power corrupts, as we all know.
Businessmen rarely are.
The Battle for Europe
But in arithmetic terms it is less favourable to the smaller countries, since they lose their weighting advantage.
The facts tell a different story.
But reform won't happen without the right majority in the Council of Ministers.
Do they want a politically integrated EU?
In the long run, do they want something approaching a federal Union?
The 10 new EU members do not have the same history as the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.
This is just talk: Tony Blair has not the faintest idea about what the center of Europe means.
What will they do?
Perhaps because they are older and more cynical, European societies seem to bask in a “collective moroseness,” from which they have difficulty emerging.
Comparisons have been made with Occupy Wall Street.
There is a strong leftist bent to the Turkish Spring.
Erdoğan, on the other hand, is still very popular in rural and provincial Turkey, among people who are less educated, poorer, more conservative, and more religious.
Young religious women are turning up at urban universities.
Many of the new entrepreneurs, like the women in headscarves, are from villages in Anatolia.
But to say that Turkey has become more democratic is not to say that it has become more liberal.
This is also one of the problems revealed by the Arab Spring.
But those voices, especially in revolutionary times, are rarely moderate.
So it is in the painful political transitions in the Middle East.
But right now, in most parts of the Middle East, they do not.
This is no reason to support Erdoğan and his shopping-mall builders against the protesters in Turkey, either.
The Battle for Turkey’s Constitution
Win or lose, that is unlikely to change.
The Battle for Ukraine
The way ahead is a minefield.
It will try to divide the country between Russian and Ukrainian speakers.
Stand with us.
The Battle of the Bonds
The oldest rule in personal finance is to avoid debt – that is, never spend more than you earn.
The same attitude governed institutional debt.
The moneylender was the most hated figure in medieval Europe.
The Beautiful Game’s Ugly Blemish
Under current conditions, the berating of the referee by the slighted team’s players consumes more game time than any review ever will.
Consider how an essentially equivalent technology has successfully reduced line-related controversies in major tennis tournaments.
After all, the US National Basketball Association employs three referees on a playing surface one-ninth the size of a football field.
Of course, we are fully aware that human error will never be eliminated from affecting outcomes in any sport.
Indeed, we actually believe that the “we wuz robbed” dimension of all sports adds to their lore and legend.
Those elections were flawed.
Electronic voting, used at 10% of polling stations, also caused problems.
Even though voters could choose between electronic and paper ballots, difficulties remained, especially among older voters.
So how bad was the election?
Or the 89 charges of violations filed by just one bloc?
He resigned only after winning election to parliament.
Nevertheless, the elections represented significant progress.
First, they were competitive.
But, despite ample funding and abundant media access, Asar finished third.
For the first time, parties could make their case in seven debates aired on national television.
Another first was that observers from all parties monitored the polling.
But nor is Kazakhstan seeking to do so.
The government wanted to protect its sources.
According to The Economist: “The Congress Party…is in a funk” and “in danger of…long-term decline.”
For starters, in 2004, the Congress was challenging an incumbent government that had served for six years.
Brazenly corrupt leaders such as Kumari Mayawati of Uttar Pradesh and Digambar Kamat of Goa were each bundled out after one term.
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination over two decades ago created a wave of sympathy for his widow, Sonia, on whose sari-tails the Congress won in 2004.
But the real problem is that brand-name politics is increasingly at a discount in India, much as it is in the United States.
Like the Kennedy and Bush brands, the Nehru-Gandhi label has lost its luster in India.
Individuals born after 1975 now account for a very large proportion of the electorate.
They are right.
Many Chinese investors view the CFIUS screening process as protectionist and targeted at them, but there is no evidence of this.
And what is the best combination of spending cuts and tax hikes?
That is a mistake.
I thought otherwise, based on research underlying my 2009 book with Carmen M. Reinhart, This Time is Different.
The trouble is that this is no ordinary recession, and a lot people have not had any punch yet, let alone too much.
They should be spiking the punch bowl more, not taking it away.
Cartography’s New Golden Age
Similarly, a digital map can be tailored to an individual’s interests or needs.
But a tourist might prefer a map that highlights specific attractions or indicates public-transport links.
Such customization leads to many millions of versions of the world – all of them accurate.
While today’s online cartographers do not face the same risks, they, too, are embarking on a journey into the unknown in search of knowledge, excitement, and better lives.
A New World’s New Development Bank
We share these concerns.
The US faces similar pressures, even though we are one of the world’s most open economies.
In this and other bilateral dialogues, the US has demonstrated that we welcome and encourage the rise of a prosperous and stable China.
We supported China’s membership in the World Trade Organization, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Financial Action Task Force.
The Berlusconi Paradox
ROME – One storm has passed in Italy.
Standing alongside Berlusconi, they did indeed rise, but the tycoon’s star out-shone their own.
The overt government backing provided to Berlusconi’s Mediaset against Rupert Murdoch’s Sky caused a far greater stir internationally than it did in Italy.
These are the machinations of Italian politics.
One reason for this is the difference between the cultures of basic science and applied science.
In the Muslim world, applied science has even more religious and political entanglements.
The best and the brightest young Muslims go into applied science, while basic science languishes.
With their important role in modernization, applied scientists engage in cultural debates as well.
A doctor may choose a secular path, or try to integrate a traditional faith with a modern profession.
Today, however, applied science is also useful knowledge for the modern world.
Religiously colored political violence will always attract some professionals.
The Best Investments
KOLKATA – On the eastern edge of Kolkata, Dulu Bibi, a 25-year-old mother of four, worries about the cost of treating her two sick boys.
Her husband earns 80-90 rupees ($1.90 or €1.40) a day.
The family’s basic diet is low in the essential micronutrients that children need to thrive.
Micronutrient deficiency is known as “hidden hunger.”
Providing Vitamin A for a year costs as little as $1.20 per child, while providing Zinc costs as little as $1.00.
But it happens whether we like it or not.
Whenever a government attempts to liberalize the electricity industry, unions and firms join forces in opposition.
(Goldman Sachs became eligible for subsidized Fed loans by turning itself into a holding company).
The main idea is to reduce the risks that can be taken by any financial institution that is backed by the federal government.
The classic case is Britain’s Royal Bank of Scotland, which is not an investment bank.
The commercial banks’ main losses were incurred in the residential and commercial housing market.
In fact, this chorus of abuse has already started, led by Goldman Sachs Chairman Lloyd Blankfein.
There is another interesting parallel with the New Deal.
Roosevelt got the Glass-Steagall Act through Congress within a hundred days of his inauguration.
Their needs are different, and producers around the world have, until recently, largely ignored them.
But times are changing.
The Big Chill
MOSCOW: Russian-American relations are witnessing a renewed process of deterioration.
Rot first set in during 1998 but stalled in 2000 because of the US presidential election.
The Big Easing
In short, quantitative easing is not the same thing as credit easing.
The ECB had to act when the eurozone’s financial system was close to collapse at the end of last year.
The Bigger Issue in Sudan
The CPA ended Africa’s longest civil war, which had left behind over two million dead.
Our lives, and those of all other creatures on this planet, are both part of and dependent on biodiversity.
Plants absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, thereby providing the air we breathe and helping to regulate the climate.
In fact, there is no technical reason why a species should go extinct, and great achievements in protecting biodiversity are being made.
It has been argued that much biodiversity has been lost as a result of a lack of understanding of its true value.
Its collections contain some of the largest and most comprehensive records of plant diversity in the world, and are a global point of reference for research.
The Biofuels Trade Challenge
After all, every liter of petrol that is replaced with a biofuel benefits the environment. 
Brazil, which is now the world’s largest producer and exporter of ethanol, is a case in point.
The Black Hole in America’s GDP
Or will something else come along to turn the economy around.
The Blinders of History
First of all, when and where was World War III?
Less than the defeat of Germany, Austria, and the Ottoman Empire, World War I meant the suicide of Europe.
The Blinders of the Left
Is it 1956 for the Left?
Well, yes.
True, I replied; and so was slavery in the American south.
Ah, but it's not.
Ah, but it's not.
(The Taliban's strictures against women make the Nuremberg Laws look almost mild, though in spirit the two sets of decrees are one.)
This is that time.
The current favorite bogeyman is public debt.
Everyone expects some inflation.
This is only half the story, however.
The new money simply replaces the old money, which has been liquidated by economic collapse.
It is to be hoped that when its report is published in December, we will be able to answer this question.
If the company performs poorly in the three years, the manager will lose part or all of his or her accumulated bonus.
Group survival counts more than individual rights in the moral accounting of many multiculturalists.
If one is looking for an abstract principle to follow on questions of immigration, liberalism cannot provide it.
Unfortunately, the interviewer did not pursue the matter any further.
But only one such “patriot” was granted the honor of being allowed to perform this act.
Would the sybaritic, globe-trotting Lugovoi agree to wear the crown?
Running the Kremlin is, after all, a testing job.
But Lugovoi’s face, too, has also changed markedly over the last eight months of press conferences.
The Message from Boston
Many commentators remarked on Americans’ resilience, and that of Bostonians in particular.
Much like Londoners after the attacks on their public-transport system in July 2005, Boston’s citizens were determined to prove that life goes on.
The Boundaries of Anti-Semitism
So, what is new about today's anti-Semitism, asks George Fletcher?
But what about those who believe that "rich Jews" control, say, the media?
The later Evangelist John concludes that because Jews deny the Christian Messiah they must be "sons of the devil."
The caption reads: Will they kill him again?
To be sure, at the time of Jesus, Jews constituted a hegemonic majority in Jerusalem.
As though it were second nature in French culture, the director presented Shylock's attempt to collect his pound of flesh by recalling the image of the crucifixion.
It is as though a form of original sin entered a subspecies of humanity descended from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Only Palestinian victims are listed.
Under protest, the poster was withdrawn.
In contrast to the Muslim world, Europeans pride themselves on being objective.
So, no surprise, many of us left.
The challenge, then, is to prevent them from staying there and settling down.
Thus, they may be offered voting rights.
British Banks’ Comedy of Terrors
WASHINGTON, DC – The devil is always in the details.
This is reminiscent of George Orwell's Animal Farm : all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.
Yet that belief guides the Bush administration.
Bubbles do not arise out of thin air.
Most stock market booms are aborted long before the extremes reached by the recent bull market.
Indeed, President Karzai must be protected by American bodyguards.
But military victory in Iraq is the easy part.
Invasion could take place at summer's end.
It is to be hoped that Iraq's conquest will be swift and relatively painless.
The Buck Stops at the Top
Even though a CEO cannot know everything, he or she is still ultimately responsible for what occurs in the company they run.
More importantly, it is their responsibility to create a climate that encourages, or discourages, certain kinds of activities.
Bush chose as his Vice-President a man who once served as CEO of Halliburton.
Fortunately, this is a remote scenario today.
First, the good news.
The global response to the crisis may not have been stellar, but neither has it been the free-for-all that might have been feared.
Globalization has not received a mortal blow – at least not yet.
Consider a traffic analogy.
The Burma Road Goes Through Beijing
In their eyes, this leaves them with virtually no choice but to hold on to power at all costs.
China is also Burma’s largest military supplier.
The road to change in Burma runs through Beijing.
The Bush Black Hole
In 2001, President George W. Bush misled the American people.
Wrong again.
In 2003 President Bush misled the American people about the economy once more.
Now, under "Bush II," America is repeating that folly.
Some people abroad now tend to gloat at America's problems.
Signs abound of an impending slowdown, even of recession.
They can’t imagine the US economy slowing, or share prices falling and staying down.
Yes, the New Economy is delivering big increases in US productivity; no, the New Economy has not ended economic slowdowns or recessions.
That trade deficit is financed by foreign investments in America, as savers the world over increase their holdings of US stocks and bonds.
The Bush in Obama
In fact, even the explanation of why this material is classified cannot be reproduced, because it is privileged.
The Bush Repression
Others are emerging gradually.
Of course, civil liberties were bound to suffer in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
The list does not stop there.
Medical research nowadays increasingly sounds like business.
Gene sequences are patented; cord blood is a hot property.
Blood can serve as the basis for immortalized cell lines in biological studies and in developing pharmaceutical products.
Biopsied tissues are used to manufacture therapeutic genetic material.
Human tissue, organs and cells are used in place of animal tissue for testing pharmaceuticals and cosmetics because animals are expensive and using them incites protests. 
Body tissue also has commercial value beyond medicine.
But few laws are in place to address the uses of cells, tissues, and genes. 
Who should profit from parts taken from an individual's body?
During WWII, the Dutch for example, were reluctant to give blood that could help German soldiers.
Banked cord blood and collected tissues can yield not only research materials, but information about future genetic conditions as well.
Who should have access to these samples?
For what purposes can they be used?
But regulatory obstacles and unexploited marketplace gaps also prevent private capital from flowing to the poorest countries.
The entrepreneurial energy is already there: visit the tiniest town in the poorest country on market day and you will see the private sector in action.
If small businesses could expand beyond the village square, they could drive their countries' growth better than any aid agency.
Some preliminary conclusions have already emerged:
Yet many poor countries have untapped financial resources.
In Canada, as in the US and Western Europe, a modest home, a small plot of land or a solid credit history can be enough to secure a loan.
But many countries--54, in fact--were poorer in 2000 than they were in 1990, as documented in the 2003 UN Human Development Report .
This phenomenon is relatively new.
The attraction of remaining in power is getting stronger across the region.
The California Syndrome
The state had America’s best public schools and state universities.
The unemployment rate, at 12.4%, is higher than in every other state except Nevada.
The state is an epicenter of the housing bust and the foreclosure crisis.
Governor Jerry Brown (who was also Governor in the 1970’s) inherits a budget deficit of $26 billion.
California’s government collects about one-half of its income-tax revenue from the top 1% of the state’s taxpayers.
Among US states, California still ranks first in technology, agriculture, and entertainment.
Skin cancer, long thought to be a disease of little public health significance, has now become epidemic.
Melanoma will cause 8,000 deaths, and non-melanoma skin cancer will kill another 2,000.
Melanoma is now the most common cancer in women aged 24 to 35.
Creating a culture of cave dwellers is no way to decrease the incidence of skin cancer. 
But in both cases, a tan is the body's response to injury.
It is irrelevant whether the ultraviolet radiation came from a bulb or a star.
Whether natural or artificial, ultraviolet radiation causes the skin to age prematurely.
There are enough other diseases about which we do not have a clue as to the cause.
With skin cancer, we know very well how we can prevent it - and prevention is always easier than treatment. 
While pseudoscience and the anti-aging industry represent an important source of potential misinformation, the Internet often provides damaging false information as well.
The Carry Trade Carries On
That is fine in theory, but where do such assets come from?
Some stock prices are normally relatively uncorrelated with the market.
But not all investors are able to trade derivatives.
The relationship between the Chinese economy and the Australian dollar is another interesting example.
That means that buying the Australian dollar is seen as a proxy for investing in China.
Even today, donor governments’ aid efforts are poorly directed.
This intensifies poverty in the next generation, as average farm sizes shrink.
Malawi today is an urgent case in point.
This is a year of both widespread hunger and solemn promises by the rich countries.
And oh, of course, it would cut into their profits, too!
That is one reason why international bankers love international coordination.   
The rule would have to be: if you want to serve my market, you must play by my rules.
The Case against Kosovo Independence
Consider, first, that Kosovo is the historical heart and religious soul of Serbia.
Hundreds of Serb Orthodox churches, monasteries, and holy sites in Kosovo attest to this.
Worse, ordinary Serbs see an obvious international double standard.
Why is Kosovo being treated differently?
Indeed, Serbia currently contains the largest refugee population in Europe.
First, faceless ethnic secessionists attack civilians and police.
And, in the denouement, the state loses control of its province as the secessionists declare independence.
The former Yugoslavia has had enough destruction and mass killing.
Britain’s European Home
Any attempt by the United Kingdom to repatriate powers to Westminster is likely to be a drawn-out and cumbersome negotiation.
Ultimately, of course, whether to repatriate competences or exit from the EU are decisions for the British government and the British people to make.
The EU is much more than a set of rules governing the internal market and the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people.
It is a unique and historic project that has unified the European continent.
I believe in the UK’s role in helping to lead this project – in Europe’s interest and its own.
I believe him when he says that he wants the UK to remain a member of the EU.
January 1, 2013, marked 40 years of British membership of the EU.
But “Main Street” sees what happens on Wall Street – and in London and Frankfurt.
If there is a better idea for fair burden-sharing between the world’s Main Streets and its Wall Streets, let’s hear it.
Two aspects of that calculation are critical.
Immigrants, however, face a different set of alternatives; with wages in Brussels far higher than in Manila, for example, Filipino immigrants are generally happy to do such work.
Zionists in Palestine rejoiced in 1947, following the UN General Assembly vote for partition into a Jewish and an Arab state.
Palestine’s quest for statehood within the borders of June 4, 1967, falls squarely within international law.
The UN Security Council resolved in November of that year that “acquisition of territory by war” is unacceptable.
According to Mousa Abu Marzook, Hamas’s deputy leader, his movement is not opposed to Abbas’s diplomatic initiative.
The fastest population growth is taking place in the poorest regions.
That would be a big mistake.
The Case of Myrna Mack: Laying out Guatemala\u0027s Crimes
Myrna worked as an anthropologist, but the army failed to see her work as scholarly.
Instead, intelligence officials viewed Myrna as an "internal enemy."
Shortly after she published her first study, government security forces began to investigate her.
A military court issued a warrant for their arrest.
In name, Guatemala is a fledgling democracy.
The Caucasian Dark Circle
MOSCOW – The Russian authorities have recently begun showing off the massive security measures being implemented ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
Two horrific wars with local separatists, from 1994-1996 and from 1999- 2006, have been fought over Chechnya, presumably to secure Russia’s territorial integrity.
The irony is that, like the Kremlin and its allies, the Islamists do not want to separate.
They dream about a Caliphate that would include much more of the Russian Federation than the North Caucasus.
The Caucasus Imperative
YEREVAN – Summit season is upon us.
The first was held in 1994 in Budapest, the year the group transformed itself into a new, post-détente organization.
That prospect holds both great opportunity and serious risks.
This year, Azerbaijan’s military budget alone exceeded total state spending in Armenia and Karabakh.
He will continue to dole out oil-based subsidies in the well-worn Venezuelan tradition of Marcos Pérez Jiménez and Carlos Andrés Pérez.
This mountainous town, situated on the banks of the Kunhar River, has been destroyed.
There is rubble and the gut-wrenching smell of decaying corpses.
These families have lost everything but the tattered clothes on their backs.
We saw helicopters attempt aerial drops; landing is impossible in most places.
The clock is ticking.
In two months, the mountains will get their first snowfall and temperatures will plummet below zero.
The task of saving lives has barely begun.
Nearly 31 years ago, on 25th December 1974, a powerful earthquake flattened towns along the Karakorum Highway and killed nearly 10,000 people.
I traveled with a university team into the same mountains for similar relief work.
Will today’s government do better?
Civil society groups must now assert themselves.
The Challenges Of EU Enlargement
But with enlargement come challenges.
Regrettably, one channel of greater integration has been muted: the free movement of labor.
The Lisbon Strategy needs to be refocused.
The Chancellor Who Played with Fire
Her response to the European crisis has prevailed – or at least that is the impression that she conveys, and that most Germans believe. So everything is fine and dandy, right?
If a majority of the French come to believe that a course of action is being imposed on them from outside – and by Germany, no less! – they will respond with traditional Gallic stubbornness.
And the central question is not, “What needs to be done now in the interest of Europe?”
The biggest obstacle until now has been the United States.
For instance, as the Arctic ice cap melts, less sunlight is reflected.
And there is more than a grain of truth to these concerns.
In the post-Cold War era, “multilateralism” has become the latest political buzzword.
Turkey’s power rests primarily on its vibrant economy.
But the Qataris may be overplaying their hand.
Neighboring Iran seems to be the quintessential survivor.
Islamist-led governments must deliver on the socioeconomic front, while building democratic institutions.
The Chaotic Birth of South Sudan
Lasting 22 years, that war left more than two million dead.
He might not find that very difficult.
Black Africa, particularly the East African Community, cannot think of any solution other than secession.
Hence, as the Kenyans put it, the border between northern and southern Sudan should become the border between Black Africa and the Arab World.
The Chechen Precedent
For the game to go on indefinitely, you must maintain the trust of the other players.
That will not be easy.
The China Bears’ Feeble Growl
First, China’s housing market is on the brink of collapse.
Indeed, it is not yet near to hitting the rocks.
As a result, prices fell in October for the first time this year, while real-estate investment growth fell as well.
By 2010, some 6,576 LFPs had been created.
So, while China should not be complacent about local-government debt, panic is unwarranted.
The real test has yet to come.
Even though relations with the US have improved, the People’s Republic is far from being trusted.
China’s active leadership of the SCO has resulted in policies that it favors.
But China’s regional diplomacy goes far beyond the SCO.
But, while everyone else ponders China’s motives, its government is acting.
Of course, it’s a two-way street.
Even the selection of Beijing as the site of the 2008 Olympics benefited from “African votes.”
Just as the world confronted the “German Question” 125 years ago, it is now confronting the “China Question.”
The China Threat, Part Two?
A brief incursion by a Chinese submarine into Japanese territorial waters a few months ago caused further alarm in Tokyo.
The China-US Climate Duet
But climate change represents China’s toughest challenge in international relations since the Cold War’s end.
But China’s views have evolved.
Indeed, last March, US Climate Envoy Todd Stern began to speak positively about China’s domestic efforts to address climate change.
BEIJING – China’s GDP growth this year may approach 10%.
China has sustained rapid economic growth for 30 years without significant fluctuations or interruption – so far.
So they invest and speculate fiercely without much consideration of risk.
The Citizen Bank
The economic environment in which we are all living and working nowadays is particularly challenging.
Of course, to meet these needs, banks must be safer and stronger than they were prior to the crises.
This applies across industries, not just in banking.
People may not recognize any difference right now; the change that is now taking place is in its early stages.
Each new wind-power job costs the Danish taxpayer at least $119,000 (€81,000) per year.
Carbon taxes could play an important role in funding research and development.
The Climate Change Revolution
Yet truth has triumphed over political maneuvers.
Neither did Australia.
All of that will have to change.
There is now a way for individuals and companies to make their own voices heard.
It’s time for the world’s political holdouts to join that effort.
That anecdote has parallels with the current preoccupation with global warming.
But malaria is much more strongly related to health infrastructure and general wealth than it is to temperature.
COPENHAGEN – Extreme weather is often said to be one of the main reasons for taking firm action on global warming.
Yet, even a cursory reading of the graph showed clearly that many more people die from cold than from heat.
Today, about two billion people are water-stressed, meaning that they make do on less than 1,700 cubic meters (60,035 cubic feet) per year.
And, in some cases, such as increasing precipitation, global warming will have both positive and negative effects.
Coral reefs, mega-deltas (which include cities like Shanghai, Kolkata, and Dhaka), and small island states are also extremely vulnerable to rising sea levels.
The Climate of Security
Thus, less CO2 gets released into the atmosphere.
The other basic instrument includes economic incentives and disincentives.
But this is a formula for global disaster.
The world’s climate is affected by total emissions, regardless of their origin.
Asians were singled out for exclusion from 1882 onward, and, with the Immigration Restriction Act of 1924, the influx of immigrants slowed for four decades.
During the twentieth century, the nation recorded its highest percentage of foreign-born residents in 1910 – 14.7% of the population.
Data from the 2000 census show a soaring Hispanic population, owing largely to waves of new immigrants, legal and illegal.
By contrast, despite Americans’ ambivalence, the US remains a country of immigration.
The Census Bureau projects that the American population will grow 49% over the next four decades.
Equally important are immigration’s benefits for America’s soft power.
Enlightened Japanese elites are fascinated by Franco-German reconciliation.
The problem, of course, is that the concept of Asia is largely a Western one.
The Stress Nexus
Inefficient use of our resources remains the norm.
Traditionally, banks were “black boxes,” in which operations were concealed from customers.
Banks’ black-box character survived, and became an even greater source of vulnerability.
Its equivalent in the financial world should meet the same fate.
They are wrong.
In the 1980’s, Scandinavian countries stood for chronic budget deficits, high inflation, and repeated devaluations.
Today, it is difficult to imagine the mindset that prevailed before Margaret Thatcher came to power in the United Kingdom in 1979 and Ronald Reagan in the United States in 1981.
In northern Europe, the transformation of the welfare state started in Denmark in 1982.
The Danish peg – now to the euro – still holds.
Former Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar was the most radical European reformer.
Reformers have exposed the public sector to competition, not least from private providers, rendering it more efficient.
The Four Stages of Putinism
Nor was it caused by falling oil prices or US President Ronald Reagan’s military build-up.
The second stage could be called the period of storms and stresses.
But a simulacrum falls apart much faster.
Back in October 2012, they planned to negotiate with Putin about replacing him in a year or so.
At the same time, he has become unable to control infighting among the elite.
To be sure, that is not what many see.
There are several reasons for this.
The 550 scenario equates to an increase in global temperature of approximately 3°C, while the 450 scenario implies an increase of around 2°C.
Renewable energy will have a major role to play.
The Coming Ice Age in Energy Security
Gas extracted from hydrate reserves is exactly the same as the natural gas in use currently.
Japan is also well endowed, with a large potential resource just 50 kilometers south of Hamamatsu.
But the optimal method is not yet known. 
For example, one hydrate-bearing geological formation, Blake Ridge, lies 300 kilometers from Charleston, South Carolina, in the US.
Blake Ridge alone contains six times more natural gas than all American conventional reserves combined.
But this huge resource is spread out over 26,000 square kilometers and lies under 1,000 meters of water.
A more promising one lies beneath the permafrost of Prudhoe Bay, the big oil-producing region on the arctic coast of Alaska.
This deposit is smaller than Blake Ridge, but it is more concentrated and closer to the surface.
The Coming Revival in French-American Relations
The candidates differ in other ways as well.
Both Sarkozy and Royal have appealed to nationalism.
Indeed, that is not the way French politics works.
The Coming St. Putinsburg Summit
It expanded to include Russia in 1998 for political, not economic, reasons.
The Human Stew
LONDON – What defines a modern human?
They apparently also used plants with medicinal properties.
But I believe that a morphology-based species distinction is still warranted.
In the latter case, the interbreeding derived from a population known so far from only one site – Denisova cave in southern Siberia.
Fossils from there contain DNA related to, but distinct from, that of the Neanderthals.
The Confidence Game
In invading Russia in 1941, Hitler, like Napoleon, demonstrated a military overconfidence that resulted in catastrophe.
This same lack of confidence is behind the potentially explosive situations in Algeria, Tunisia, and even Morocco.
Success breeds confidence, and confidence brings progress.
The Conflicted Bank of England
And, since the UK doesn’t produce low-end manufactures anymore, they must be imported.
That, at least, is the theory.
This is pie in the sky.
And the same is true, albeit to a lesser degree, for other heavily indebted sovereigns.
The Germans should remember the reparations fiasco of the 1920’s.
New bond issues, following a big debt write-down in 1924 (the Dawes Plan), enabled Germany to borrow the money to resume payments.
The Consequences of Korean Extremism
And this in a country that had an estimated per capita income of $40 in the 1940’s but has now become the world’s 12th or 13th largest economy.
“Economic strangulation” of North Korea appears to be the fallback option.
A cooling-off period is necessary.
The Syria Lessons
Here are the lessons thus far:
But how many wars does it take for us to understand that killing always begets more killing?
The Latin Difference
But there are even older variants of the French vision of Europe.
Napoleon saw the scheme as a potential basis for a single world currency.
The alternative model to British constitutionalism was ancien régime France.
The situation was the reverse of Britain.
The United Nations spelled out the “best possible result” in 1947: Palestine – then a British mandate – was to be partitioned into two states of approximately equal size.
It just might work.
Nevertheless, even with the extra cash, neither side would be likely to accept such a simulacrum of the two-state solution.
The desire for peace is more urgent in Ramallah than in Tel Aviv.
Past conquest cannot be a legitimate basis for current rule.
The United Nations estimates that security forces have suffered 15,000 fatalities, and the opposition 10,000, and that 45,000 civilians have died in the last two years of fighting.
But to oppose extremism and support the FSA is a blatant contradiction.
And regional tensions are running high.
But, in reality, Syria has already become an enclave for extremism.
Responding with military aid will simply turn a catastrophe into an apocalypse.
Science, and the behavior of scientists, has never been perfect.
But are such boards necessary?
But in neither case has a standard method emerged for ensuring the integrity of research – or of the scientists who carry it out.
Here the inquisitors are part cost accountant, part thought police.
Cooperative movements took shape in the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Japan in the 1800’s.
The Copenhagen Panic
Emissions overshot the target by 12%.
In a world of mobile capital, corporate-tax rates matter, and business decisions about how and where to invest are increasingly sensitive to national differences.
In doing so, the US would break no international commitments and would not start a trade war.
The Cost of Dick Cheney
The autobiographies of political leaders are not a very elevated literary form.
Third, these books are usually written largely for a big paycheck.
The Cost of the Gender Gap
A cross section of 40 poor and rich countries shows that there is a strong relationship between women’s economic and social status and overall economic growth.
Policy measures that cultivate traditional role patterns should be abolished.
However, the tables have turned.
In the Philippines, 89% of companies have women in senior management positions.
In Europe, women long ago bridged the education gap with their male peers.
Except for Scandinavia, the number of women on Europe’s top company boards is stagnating.
But European women are to blame as well.
Now that position has been bluntly and uncompromisingly expressed.
Britain has made major positive contributions to Europe, particularly with respect to the single market.
A Golden Rice Opportunity
A study from the British medical journal The Lancet estimates that, in total, vitamin A deficiency kills 668,000 children under the age of five each year.
Both are great deals.
Similarly, it is argued that golden rice will not be adopted, because most Asians eschew brown rice.
But farmers have a choice.
Now, finally, golden rice will come to the Philippines; after that, it is expected in Bangladesh and Indonesia.
But, for eight million kids, the wait was too long.
Overcautious Obama
Consider Syria.
He knows that any weapon capable of shooting down a Syrian warplane could also be used by a terrorist against a US airliner.
No one speaks for the Syrian people in the Oval Office every morning.
The Courage of Convictions
Mr. Blair's posture is all the more remarkable at a time when political leaders depend on opinion polls and the views expressed by so-called "focus groups" to tell them what to think.
Perhaps Schröder should spare a thought for his two great predecessors, Konrad Adenauer and Willy Brandt.
Charles de Gaulle prevailed politically after ending French colonial rule in Algeria.
These leaders seemed to be working against the grain, but the grain itself was about to change direction.
There are those who think that this is precisely what might happen to Mr. Blair over Iraq.
The G-20 summit in Washington in 2008 was the first at which the member countries’ chiefs of state met since the group’s creation in 1997.
There is no possible alternative.
The US, the EU, and Japan are in favor, while emerging countries, as well as Canada and Australia, are opposed.
Both are necessary.
People’s anguish demands this effort, and it was lacking in Toronto.
The main challenge now is to continue using the “geometry of 20” to build instruments of world governance.
The degree of interdependence among countries is increasing, and the global nature of our problems is inherent.
That is true today as well.
On June 16, 1940, Winston Churchill proposed a Franco-British political union in the aftermath of the German invasion of France.
Is Europe’s current crisis severe and dislocating enough to generate an analogous effect?
The Crisis Down Under
CANBERRA – The Great Recession of 2008 reached the farthest corners of the earth.
Here in Australia, they refer to it as the GFC – the global financial crisis.
Australia is lucky to have a rich endowment of natural resources, including iron ore.
This money should be set aside in a special fund, to be used for investment.
The international community banded together, banned the substances, and the holes are now closing.
But another part of our legacy is environmental.
There is no simple return to a pre-crisis normalcy.
Something changes permanently.
American-style consumption offered a new model of economic development.
It inspired widespread emulation.
The aura of a brand is easily destroyed.
The consumer age was the product of two previous crises.
On the other hand, the consumption of experiences (rather than objects) produces a more sustained satisfaction.
Politics, it is said, is the art of the possible.
But possibilities are shaped by our decisions as much as they are by our circumstances.
The Crisis of Thai Democracy
Although his Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party commands a 75% majority in the assembly, Thaksin is embattled.
Voters overwhelmingly returned Thaksin to office in February 2005.
His predicament illustrates the common dictum in the politics of developing countries where rural electorates elect governments but urban elites get to throw them out.
Thai politics has thus reached an impasse.
Only intervention by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is widely revered, seems capable of saving the day.
The King’s intervention would put an unconditional stop to the street confrontations.
The Crisis of the Left
In the past, the left was equipped with its own ideology, its own economic theory.
But the world has changed, and the left's old view simply no longer applies.
The same tension exists within parties themselves.
Shift everything a bit to the left, and you arrive at the problems facing President Lula Ignacio da Silva in Brazil.
One of the first lessons of economics is that there is a trade-off between efficiency and redistribution.
The right focuses on efficiency. The left emphasizes redistribution. 
Governments with a mandate to domesticate financial markets appear to have produced a lot of sound and fury, but little reform.
Almost two years on, financial reform remains incomplete, as the agenda itself is still evolving.
The era when London vaunted its light-touch regulation is over.
The history books are not yet written, nor the victor declared.
What if no fog prevented the safe landing at Smolensk airport?
Certainly, no Russians were invited.
The Katyn massacre was a direct result, with Stalin ordering the mass murder of Poland’s elite in order to decapitate Polish society and thus make it more pliable.
Although the Nazi-Soviet Pact did not last long – Germany invaded Russia in 1941 – for Poland there was no way out.
With Hitler’s defeat, it once again became part of the Russian sphere, this time of Soviet Russia.
The Cultural Bias of Genetics
In the field of human origins, it is well-known that a human DNA sequence is nearly 99% identical to the corresponding part of a chimpanzee’s DNA.
Once again, social meanings are enmeshed within beliefs about heredity.
Because a DNA sequence is a one-dimensional entity, it lends itself much better to single-number comparisons than a four-dimensional body does.
Two DNA sequences generated at random must be 25% identical, by virtue of the fact that DNA is a sequence of only four bases.
The Cultural Contradictions of Multiculturalism
STOCKHOLM – State-sponsored multiculturalism has failed.
Swedes are overwhelmingly secular and indifferent toward the Swedish church.
Moreover, Sweden’s far-reaching freedom of expression is one reason why Assange located WikiLeaks’ servers in the country.
But Sweden’s freedom of expression was also one of the motives behind a grisly suicide attack in Stockholm in December of last year.
Two young men were recently sentenced to prison for trying to set fire to the artist’s home.
Only a few of the country’s newspapers and political magazines published Vilks’ drawings.
In this respect, Vilks’ work must be regarded as having succeeded in exposing moral double standards – no matter what one thinks of the drawing itself.
Most victims also use various excuses to bottle up their memories.
Consider Ye Xiangzhen, the daughter of senior general Ye Jianying, who once discussed her family’s Cultural Revolution experiences on television.
People in the Ukrainian town of Kherson are more entrepreneurial than people from Kiev.
What can these differences tell us about the real causes of entrepreneurship?
She compared Clermont-Ferrand, the capital of Auvergne, in the center of France, with Paris.
Auvergne’s inhabitants have a reputation for being parsimonious and stern, and, despite substantial recent progress, for a relative dearth of high culture.
But that would not be the story in Europe.
The euro will stay at around 90% of the dollar and may not even pay a weekend visit at parity.
There won't much European growth, but nor will there be an outright growth crisis either.
What would happen?
The Middle East, North Korea, Darfur, Central and East Africa, the Caucasus – in none of these places can the US still act successfully on its own.
Madeleine Albright once called the US the “indispensable nation.”
She was right then, and she is still right today.
But they are very different.
Nowadays, however, a cyclical collapse comes as a great surprise.
The world needed to be rethought in 1979, 1989, 1998, and 2008.
Ten years later, in 1989, the Soviet model of economic planning and modernization through centrally directed growth was discredited.
The next beautiful idea that failed, in 1997-1998, was the concept of a particular “Asian miracle” (as it had been dubbed in the title of an influential World Bank publication).
If the major English-speaking economies remain open and do not close themselves off to trade and immigration, they will also see a return to growth.
The Dirge of Cyprus
The war has been won; but Otello’s achievement is later destroyed by his jealousy.
In Germany, the epicenter of democracy’s collapse, radicals on both the right and the left raged against the postwar peace settlement and the Versailles Treaty.
That is true in today’s Europe as well.
Trans fats are unsaturated fatty acids with at least one double bond in the trans configuration.
Furthermore, trans fats from partially hydrogenated oils have no intrinsic health value.
This has been clearly demonstrated in both Denmark and the Netherlands.
We must not lose sight of the cataclysmic consequences that could result if such violence is not curbed.
There, too, a committed democrat, Abdurrahman Wahid (Gus Dur), has become President after an extended period of corrupt and brutal military rule.
CAMBRIDGE – This year has begun on a note of cautious optimism for the global economy.
So, where will the extra imports needed to support all of this additional exporting come from?
It is here that economists disagree.
Forecasting is always difficult, but especially so in troubled times.
The Dangers of Gray Power
In the US, retirees tend to vote more than the young.
Second, eliminate the redistribution implicit in the system.
MOSCOW – Russia and the United States have signed a new strategic nuclear-arms reduction treaty (START).
Nevertheless, the treaty is a considerable achievement.
Many Europeans, above all in the new NATO member-states, would then demand more protection from the mythical Russian Leviathan.
What is most needed nowadays is clear thinking about how to live with an expanding club of nuclear states while keeping the world relatively stable.
The Dark Matter of Financial Globalization
And why did systemic risk increase rather than decrease in recent years?
1. massive uncertainty about the size of the losses.
The Dark Side of Defending Freedom
Under the cover of the Cold War, Western governments were regularly forced to make many strategically realistic but morally noxious decisions.
The fate of the Chagossians, the former residents of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean, is particularly harrowing.
The Chagossians were shipped off to the Seychelles and Mauritius, where they were deposited and left to fend for themselves.
They were ostracized and isolated.
Many Chagossians eventually moved away from the Seychelles and Mauritius.
Some settled in London (my European Parliament constituency).
The Chagossians want to return to the outer islands of the Chagos archipelago.
The Dark Side of Self-Determination
Self-determination is generally defined as the right of a people to form its own state.
Part of northern Kenya was inhabited by Somalis.
The result was a series of wars in northeast Africa over the Somali nationalist question.
Does secession harm those left behind?
They argued that the oil belonged to all of Nigeria’s people, not just the eastern area.
In Yugoslavia, the Slovenes, Serbs, and Croats managed to carve out independent republics in the early 1990’s, but the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina were less successful.
Self-determination has turned out to be an ambiguous moral principle.
Adolf Hitler used the principle to undermine fragile states in the 1930’s.
The best hope for the future is to ask what is being determined as well as who determines it.
The Dead Cat Bounce
The stock market’s latest “dead cat bounce” may last a while longer, but three factors will, in due course, lead it to turn south again.
The Dear Leader Cleans House for the Young General
That was then.
Economists have no trouble explaining the dollar’s weakness after the fact.
I should know.
Subsequently the dollar did decline.
But then it shot up again following the failure of Bear Stearns and the problems with AIG.
But their choice boils down to buying US dollars or buying US goods.
One popular scenario is chronic inflation.
But high debts will mean high taxes.
The Death of King Fahad
King Fahad, the longest-serving king in Saudi Arabia’s history (24 years), is dead.
Divisions in the kingdom are sharper than ever, and the King’s death might deepen them further.
Russia found a young reformer in Mikhail Gorbachev too late.
It may also be too late for Saudi Arabia.
The Death of NATO
Death, of course, comes to all living things.
So NATO remains in business, and in Afghanistan.
But each now resents the behavior of the other.
NEW DELHI – This is a tipping point for Pakistan.
After all, Pakistan is a nuclear-armed, terrorist-spawning regional power.
The consequences of partition, however, remain: Pakistan has not yet been able to evolve an administratively credible government.
That is why in Islamic jurisprudence, laws must be derived from the Koran and the Sunnah of the Prophet, not handed down from British or classical philosophy.
So the central issue in Islam has not been whether the state can be separated from religion, but whether society can be so separated.
Indeed, the issue that now lies at Pakistan’s core is whether it can become a theocratic state.
According to the chief of the Jamaat-e-Islami movement, “the killed is himself responsible for his killing.”
Here, in this desire, is where Pakistan’s ultimate reckoning is to be found, not in the corridors of Washington, and certainly not on the broad avenues of Islamabad.
The Death of Poland\u0027s Socrates
NEW YORK – One of the most important men you probably never heard of died last Friday.
Leszek Kolakowski was one of these people.
In his early youth, he witnessed the atrocities of World War II in his native Poland.
Kolakowski came back to Poland a number of times in his last years, although he never settled there again.
When he died, the Polish Parliament observed a minute of silence.
Poland went into mourning.
But the man himself was never a monument.
Another quality he shared with Socrates.
As a result, the Putin era has become utterly sterile, producing no great works of science, literature, or art.
The grand expansion of the Soviet empire enabled humankind’s exploration of the cosmos and its potential expansion beyond Earth.
None of these intellectuals is against globalization, of course.
Banknotes are just pieces of paper with a number attached to them.
We do not grow up wishing to work for crooks and liars.
Once that trust breaks, bad things happen.
A year ago, inflation was “only” 100,000%.
But the Weimar Republic and China in the 1940’s were.
One opted for Hitler and the other for Mao Zedong to restore trust.
If we cannot rely on the best auditors, can we continue to trust chartered accountants?
Will we ever again be able to trust a triple A rating issued by, say, Moody’s?
This is a contradiction with global implications.
Financial booms provide collateral that supports debt-financed spending.
Choosing the latter option would have devastating consequences.
Similar trends are evident in Germany, Spain, and France.
But even Americans are divided equally about whether China will replace the US as a global superpower.
In the 1950’s and 1960’s, after Sputnik, many thought that the Soviets might get the better of America; in the 1980’s, it was the Japanese.
Now it is the Chinese.
It is as if Mexico and Canada sought a Chinese alliance to balance the US in North America.
Moreover, the US remains at the forefront of such cutting-edge technologies as biotech and nanotechnology.
The Decline of Ahmedinejad
The Islamic Republic’s first president, Abolhassan Bani Sadr, was dismissed from office a year after his election.
The US can also be a force for great ill.
This will be good for the world because prosperity will be more widely spread, even if America's ego gets hurt in the process.
The Decline of France?
In short, Baverez's analysis points in the wrong direction.
Until 1981, France had a clear division between right and left.
The Paranoid Style in Economics
Customers often value a good more when its price goes up.
Physicists do not need to know the behavior of every molecule to predict how a gas will behave under pressure.
Economists cannot be so sanguine.
But, under other conditions, individuals influence one another in such a way that the crowd becomes a herd, led by a few.
Models, thus simplified, suggested policies that seemed to work –&#160;that is, until the plumbing backed up.
And the plumbing malfunctioned because herd behavior – shaped by policies in ways that we are only now coming to understand – overwhelmed it.
The Defeated Remain Defiant
Zimbabwe's people did not get one.
In our investigations so far, a pattern has emerged even at this early stage: these polling stations recorded the highest number of voters for Mugabe.
Whatever may happen, I as the people's loyal servant am with them all the way.
Among ordinary Zimbabweans walk heroes - heroes who waited hours and hours to vote, heroes who refused to be turned away.
My people are in their hour of greatest need.
But there is one sector of our lives where adoption of information technology has lagged conspicuously: health care.
Indeed, in those countries, the practice is now nearly universal.
Yet some other high-income countries, such as the United States and Canada, are not keeping up.
In other words, a hospital’s IT system often cannot “talk” to others.
In a medical emergency, it can impose life-threatening delays in care.
A third way that health IT in America differs from consumer IT is usability.
In fact, many complain that it slows them down.
Absolutely not.
The fact that the US has not gotten there yet is not a problem of vision, but of less-than-ideal implementation.
The gap between what IT promised and what it delivered in the early days was so stark that experts called it the “IT productivity paradox.”
In 2009, Congress passed the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act.
HITECH has undeniably accelerated IT adoption among health-care providers.
Yet the problems of usability and interoperability persist.
Properly applied, health IT can improve health care in all of these dimensions.
The payoff will be worth it.
ROME: Governments from around the world will gather in Brussels under UN auspices on May 14th to discuss the plight of poor countries.
For little more than a year ago they agreed to forgive much of the debt of the world’s poorest countries.
In many of them, public expenditure favor the middle and upper middle classes; above all, it favors city dwellers.
The Demise of Parliaments
Europe's "presidential" prime ministers, on the contrary, are what a British Lord Chancellor once called, "elective dictators."
This means, above all, that they have ceased to take parliaments seriously.
(The absurd consequence is that the unelected House of Lords becomes the real legislature of the country.)
All governments have acquired the habit of using secondary legislation by orders and regulations without parliamentary control.
The Council of course meets in camera , that is without public scrutiny.
How could this happen?
Is democracy itself at risk?
Decisions have emigrated from the spaces for which parliaments are elected.
The party game has lost its representative quality.
As reasoned debate falls by the wayside, citizens lose interest in politics.
Along with parties and parliaments, elections have lost their charm.
Thus, foreign producers can’t compete unless their costs are $1.05 per gallon lower than those of American producers.
Brazilian sugar-based ethanol costs far less to produce than American corn-based ethanol.
The Democracy Paradox
The Democrat’s Disease
That question will be on the lips of many of Romania’s reformers and democrats when going to the polls next week for general and presidential elections.
None of this happened and Romanians feel betrayed.
Economic dissatisfaction, however, does not account for all Romania’s frustrations.
Particularly significant were increases from 24% to 63% during this period among Sunnis and from 41% to 65% among Kurds.
The figure is 11% in Cairo, Egypt, and 17% in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
For example, new factories and mines require land.
A similar story played out elsewhere.
Emerging markets around the world enjoyed a spectacular recovery.
The resulting supply constraints exacerbated inflation.
In addition to more investment, India needs less consumption and higher savings.
In short, our new Report is a call to action.
Our report makes dozens of such practical recommendations.
Anti-retroviral medicines can help save millions from death due to AIDS.
These investments are an incredible bargain.
Ghana, Senegal, Tanzania, Kenya, and Ethiopia are on that list.
In fact, since WWII, only George W. Bush’s economic advisers have broken with this consensus.
Americans need to be told a simple, mathematical truth.
The Denial of Caste
India's ancient and medieval history is notoriously malleable.
The country's Hindu nationalists unleashed the latest furor over the nature of India's past.
Some archaeological evidence exists.
Before this, these historians argue, Hindus were allegedly no less individualistic than Europeans.
While visiting Kerala in the late 1960's, I--a Hindu from the Gangetic heartland--went to the Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple in Trivandrum, where the usual "pandas" accosted me.
One asked where I came from and asked about my jati and gotra .
Serfdom, indenture, slavery, and the caste system all served this end.
In some European countries, like France and Ireland, the population will actually rise. But in others there will be steep falls.
Two strategic footnotes need to be added to this scenario.
First, Turkey’s population is likely to rise hugely in the next 50 years, from 66m to nearly 100m.
"The dollar is our currency and your problem."
As a recent study by J.P. Morgan's Chief Economist John Lipsky shows, the link between exchange rates and trade is weakening.
By contrast, the eurozone stands out for being a deliberate creation.
It is arguably the world’s second-largest, deliberately-planned economic structure, after Communism.
If Europe succeeds in making major fiscal and banking reforms and gets its economy in order, Edward will lose steam.
If not, the crisis will persist, and Europe will be rocked as Edward makes landfall by the end of 2014.
It will be a bumpy road ahead, requiring careful navigation and bold policy implementation.
The Diabetes Watch
WELLINGTON – The world is currently in the grip of a diabetes epidemic.
The number could be 370 million today.
Globally, the type 2 diabetes epidemic has been growing in lockstep with rising obesity levels.
This is not surprising – an increase in body fat and a decrease in physical activity are the direct causes of type 2 (as opposed to type 1) diabetes.
Diabetes already is the major cause of kidney failure, blindness, and lower-limb amputation in many countries, and a major cause of heart attacks and strokes.
There is nothing in this definition that restricts surveillance to communicable diseases, yet in practice this has generally been the case.
The situation regarding chronic diseases like diabetes is very different.
Yet effective chronic disease surveillance can save lives.
This data would then be securely transferred (electronically) to a suitable data warehouse.
After appropriate cleaning (checking for missing data, correcting coding errors), and anonymizing, the data would be available for access and querying.
This low-tech product was revolutionary.
In effect, the rice plants’ inputs are carbon dioxide, water, soil, and the sun’s energy, and its output is a rice kernel containing large amounts of the proteins.
The kernel is processed to extract and purify the proteins, which are then used to formulate the improved rehydration solution.
Rice is self-pollinating, so out-crossing – interbreeding with other rice varieties – is virtually impossible.
Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have faced similar regulatory obstacles in attempting to produce lysozyme in the milk of genetically engineered goats.
They don’t diet or exercise.
Conversely, up to 40% of normal-weight people have chronic metabolic disease.
Something else is going on.
As a result, our forebears’ livers stayed healthy.
So their livers also stayed healthy.
And nature did its part by supplying all naturally occurring foodstuffs with either fat or carbohydrate as the energy source, not both.
Our metabolisms started to malfunction when humans began consuming fat and carbohydrates at the same meal.
Liver fat mucks up the workings of the liver.
In other words, neither fat nor carbohydrates are problematic – until they are combined.
But there is one exception to this formulation: sugar.
Sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup are comprised of one molecule of glucose (not especially sweet) and one molecule of fructose (very sweet).
While glucose is metabolized by the glycolytic pathway, fructose is metabolized by the lipolytic pathway, and is not insulin-regulated.
Today, 33% of Americans have a fatty liver, which causes chronic metabolic disease.
Fats, carbohydrates, fructose, and glucose are all metabolized differently in the body.
Furthermore, you are what you do with what you eat.Combining fat and carbohydrate places high demands on the metabolic process. And adding sugar is particularly&#160;egregious.
People cannot be held responsible for what they put in their mouths when their choices have been co-opted.
And this brings us back to those obese toddlers.
The fructose content of a soft drink is 5.3%.
The Digital Divide
LONDON: A global division is arising between the world’s computer haves and have-nots.
Call it the digital divide.
Are computer technologies, however, really so easily transferred?
These are the pre-conditions for successful technology transfers.
Moreover, technology transfer is not free.
Still, even if governments do everything right, the benefits of ICTs for low-income countries are limited and difficult to predict.
Fueled by microchip exports (38% of the total), Costa Rica’s economy grew 8.3% in 1999, the highest in Latin America.
Domestic demand in developing and postcommunist countries lags behind because people are usually too poor to buy IT goods and services.
The Internet is of no benefit if you can’t get online.
The Digital Provide: What Information Technology Can Do For the World\u0027s Poorest
The Digital War on Poverty
Brazil now has more than 130 million subscribers, and Indonesia has roughly 120 million.
Mobile phones are now ubiquitous in villages as well as cities.
Throughout the world, schools at all levels will go global, joining together in worldwide digital education networks.
Students will share ideas through live chats, shared curricula, joint projects, and videos, photos, and text sent over the digital network.
Albert Einstein once said, “I have no special gift, but I am passionately curious.” Certainly, Einstein was being tremendously modest.
It is a state of being involuntarily gripped by something that is difficult to ward off and for which, since one cannot act otherwise, one is accountable only in a limited sense.
This dilemma is at the center of many policy debates surrounding scientific research.
London is certainly a multicultural metropolis.
For decades (and in some cases much longer), Serbs and Croats, – indeed, Orthodox, Catholic, and Muslim “Yugoslavs” – had lived together as neighbors.
Ethnic and cultural conflicts today, often in the form of terrorism, are not the eruption of a supposedly extinct volcano.
They are, on the contrary, a specifically modern phenomenon.
But there is something more fundamental underlying diplomats’ natural diffidence.
There have been 57 accidents since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.
Accidents have also occurred when nuclear reactors are shut down for refueling or to move spent nuclear fuel into storage.
Unfortunately, on-­site accidents at nuclear reactors and fuel facilities are not the only cause of concern.
About 350,000 males would be temporarily sterile, 100,000 women would stop menstruating, and 100,000 children would be born with cognitive deficiencies.
But the historical record clearly shows otherwise.
BRUSSELS – What will it mean to be European 25 years from now?
The Disappearing Sky
As a result, the sky is usually conceptualized in terms of traffic.
Carbon and fluorocarbons affect everyone’s children.
Some suggest that sky governance follow the precedent set by the electromagnetic spectrum.
The “airwaves” are used for a variety of communications, including government use and public access like radio.
But would it be a better model of atmospheric administration?
The problem is that at least some electromagnetic waves are dangerous.
However, it is known that bees are dying in the northern hemisphere.
The primary causes of this recent epidemic are germs and mites, but these have always been with us.
We have an intuitive understanding of the importance of limits when the loss of our sky is articulated in poetic terms.
The sky must belong to the people.
The Discreet Terror of Fidel Castro
Soon afterwards, many friends and I formed the International Committee for Democracy in Cuba.
But democracy has shown weakness and the Cuban regime has in turn adapted its tactics.
On the island, such planned harassments are called “actos de repudio” – “acts of rejection.”
Some Europeans apparently regard Cuba as a faraway country whose fate they need take no interest in, because they have problems of their own.
The Diseases of Global Warming
Today few scientists doubt that Earth's atmosphere is warming.
International commerce and travel enable infectious diseases to strike continents away from their sources.
High winds--caused by parching of the earth's surface--may disperse pollution.
Extreme heat also limits mosquito survival.
Today it afflicts an estimated 50-100 million people in the tropics and subtropics.
As anticipated, warmth is climbing up many mountains.
The human health toll taken by global warming will depend to a large extent on us.
The Diseases of Globalization
Everywhere its stresses rumble.
North America, Western Europe, and Japan are bogged down in slow growth and risk renewed recession.
Consider Africa's best governed countries - Ghana, Tanzania, Malawi, Gambia.
Such a system costs, at the least, around $40 per person per year.
Successful globalization requires that we think more like doctors and less like preachers.
In some regions, such as the Andes and Central Asia, the problem is primarily geographical isolation.
As we stand at the brink of war, it is urgent that the hard job of making globalization work for all gets started.
Economists are good at identifying underlying forces, but they are not so good at timing.
The dynamics are, however, much as anticipated.
Non-violence has offered no solutions to them.
He formulated its unique content and determined its application in a specific historical context.
The Distance Between the First and Third Rome
For example, in 2001 both the Catholic and Orthodox Easter will fall on the same day – 15 April – an extremely rare occurrence.
What better pretext could there be for an ecumenical meeting?
But will the Patriarch seize the moment?
Likhachev was showing the Pope an album about the Solovetsy camp where Likhachev had been imprisoned for “religious propaganda”.
The hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church, indeed, has not admitted the sins of its collaboration with the Soviet state.
The Disuniting Kingdom?
Does an SNP-led government herald the break-up of the United Kingdom?
More broadly, does nationalism, that product of nineteenth-century politics, still have a role to play in Europe?
Gaelic is spoken by only about 80,000 of Scotland’s 5.1 million inhabitants.
Moreover, unlike East European or Balkan nationalism, the Scottish variety has little to do with ethnicity or religion.
What motivates Scottish nationalism is the strong attachment to Scotland’s civic institutions.
Distinctive Welsh institutions, apart from those concerned with the Welsh language, are difficult to identify.
The new confidence in Edinburgh, which is experiencing an economic boom, is self-evident.
What is arising is a different Scotland, and a different Britain, and this is Scotland’s lesson for Europe.
By cooperating with the rest of the United Kingdom, rather than clashing, Scotland is giving new meaning to the phrase “ever closer union.”
Initially, “globalization” was a dirty word to some.
Everyone else has “exceptional” treatment.
Some recognize the risks.
The US must lead again, as it did in the past.
And now it must do so with China at its side.
The Dollar and the Dragon
How, then, should US officials respond?
But it did.
But what is the link between the two?
Would the price of oil have increased less if oil were priced in euros instead of dollars?
And the dollar price of oil would have gone up 56%.
The Dollar’s Last Days?
Transforming the dollar standard into an SDR-based system would be a major break with a policy that has lasted more than 60 years.
But the world soon became awash in dollars.
Moreover, the European Central Bank has repeatedly stated that it neither encourages nor discourages the euro’s international role.
The Chinese proposal falls into this category.
But there is a more realistic way for the SDR’s importance to grow.
Back in 1980, the IMF came close to adopting a so-called SDR Substitution Account.
The Dollar’s Long Tail
In ancient times, India ran a large trade surplus with the Roman empire.
Rome responded by reducing the gold/silver content (the ancient equivalent of monetization), which led to sustained inflation in the empire.
In the sixteenth century, Spain emerged as a superpower following its conquest of South America.
By the middle of the nineteenth century, the world was functioning on a bi-metal system based on gold and silver.
But, following the British example, most major countries had shifted to a gold standard by the 1870’s.
It opted for the former in 1931.
Second, precious metals do not resolve the problem of inflation.
By the end of the 1960's, the pound had been so weakened that international markets lost interest.
In the end, the US forced the Japanese to revalue their currency by destroying the international monetary order in August 1971.
Only after a machine gun opens fire in one of Lebanon’s streets and its noise echoes everywhere do we find out.
Now the judges are insisting on their independence by themselves.
In neighboring Israel, which is still in a struggle with the Palestinians, only 18 were killed and 25 wounded in similar attacks during the same period.
Last July, on another national holiday, they hit three tourist spots not far from the Mubarak family compound in Sharm el-Sheikh.
Copts are the original Egyptians, and they were the majority population until the tenth century.
America’s Labor Market by the Numbers
This is certainly good news.
Consider the statistics on the duration of unemployment.
The Dragon and the Bear
In 1969, the Chinese and Soviet armies exchanged fire across their disputed border.
China’s major interest in Russia is oil and gas.
Most of the arms used were yesterday’s weapons.
But it hardly wishes to colonize the frozen wastes of Siberia.
What China wants and what it gets may be different things.
The Dream of Space
The public viewed space travel as science fiction, a form of popular entertainment thought to have little chance of realization.
But Clarke, von Braun, and others persevered.
Clarke explained how humans could build communication satellites.
In 1959, officials at the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) adopted most of these steps as part of their long-range plan.
The Soviet Union engaged the US in a race to the moon.
The movie depicted a large space station, a winged space shuttle, a lunar base, and astronauts on a trip to the outer solar system.
They sent robotic spacecraft to the moon, Venus, Mars, and other planets, and humans to the moon.
In those respects, the original vision was achieved.
The human space effort, nonetheless, departed from the plan in unexpected ways.
Early planners viewed the space station as an assembly point for expeditions to the moon and planets.
The real space station is a micro-gravity research laboratory with no capability to launch trips to the moon or beyond.
Larger capabilities were part of the original space station plan, approved in 1984, but subsequently disappeared as the cost of the facility grew.
Nor has the US space shuttle accomplished its goals.
When the space shuttle was approved in 1972, NASA officials predicted that they would launch one every week or two.
But the space shuttle has proven far more difficult and costly to operate than anticipated, flying only four times per year on average.
When the shuttle is retired around 2010, NASA will replace it with an old-fashioned spacecraft with no wings at all.
In contrast to human space flight, which has lagged behind expectations, the robotic space effort has exceeded them.
Kubrick suggested that people – accompanied by a computer – would pilot spacecraft to explore planets like Jupiter and Saturn.
Robotic spacecraft are currently returning information from the outer regions of the solar system and roving the surface of Mars.
No military force has yet perceived the need to station soldiers on its various reconnaissance, communication, or navigation satellites.
Robotic technology is advancing more rapidly than the technologies supporting human space flight.
If the past is any guide, much of what seems like science fiction today will become reality tomorrow.
No other laws generate so much corruption or such violence; and no other set of laws contributes so much to the spread of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and other diseases.
In 1980, 50,000 people were incarcerated in the US for drug law violations.
That total represents almost 10% of all the world's inmates.
Millions who smoke marijuana or consume other psychoactive drugs are harmed far more by state action than by drug use.
The euro has been firmly established as a world-class currency.
But these were small matters that were vastly distorted by critics with their own agendas for the bank.
In a recent personal interview in his Frankfurt office, I asked Duisenberg what had been his single most important accomplishment in office.
None, in fact, was needed.
The introduction of the euro currency was accomplished more smoothly than even the ECB had expected. 
This will not be easy.
Indeed, not so long ago unemployment in the Netherlands stood above 10%.
The average work week in the Netherlands (counting both those who work full-time and those who work part-time) is 27 hours, compared to 29 hours in France.
Both hostile camps are wrong.
• The second factor is cooperation among social partners.
AMSTERDAM: The Dutch like to think of themselves as leaders in social policy.
How did this happen?
The move to part-time employment in Holland was intended to increase female participation in the Dutch labor force.
Yet Holland has not gone all the way.
There appears to be a right way, a wrong way, and a Dutch way of doing things.
Continental Europe, excluding Holland, does it the wrong way.
But high productivity is not the only element of high performance.
The other element is thriving, prospering participants.
What are the requirements for dynamism?
Yale University's Robert Shiller has suggested that I believe that Europeans lack dynamism owing to a deficiency of entrepreneurial "spirit."
Evidence exists for this thesis.
The Eagle, the Peacock, and the Taliban
Francis Fukuyama’s new book The Origins of Political Order attempts to address this problem.
North argues that competition is a key force driving adaptive efficiency among institutions.
The East Asian Triangle
For stability to be preserved, Sino-Japanese relations must improve.
Yet Chinese leaders speak of China’s “peaceful rise” and “peaceful development.”
Containment was unfeasible, because, unlike the Soviet Union during the Cold War, China’s neighbors did not see it as a clear and present danger.
The strategy we chose was to “balance and integrate.”
That strategy has largely worked.
The ECB \u0026 Europe\u0027s Upswing
Will it wait for inflation to really show before firing another volley?
When in doubt, fire.
That is about to change.
The message for the ECB is clear: make haste while the sun shines.
Ironically, the October meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council will take place in Paris this year.
French Finance Minister Thierry Breton recently warned the ECB about “nasty surprises.”
Politically, the path is clear for the ECB to act.
Time and again, the lender-of-last-resort role has been an indispensable part of that function.
ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet and the Governing Council strongly disagree.
The jury is out but there is reason to be concerned.
But if it goes too fast, the political cost could be substantial and irreversible.
No matter how high rates go, they think they’re behind.
First, there has been little wage pressure so far.
But one should not expect too much from a tough ECB stance.
But the European Central Bank’s role within the eurozone nowadays is even more “central” than that of the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England.
Now that the “southern” eurozone governments’ solvency no longer seems assured, distrust has grown along national lines.
Adjustment to shocks is also independent of location in the US.
Payment imbalances between Federal Reserve districts thus cannot represent imbalances between states.
Banks thus cannot use any holdings of California or Texas state debt to obtain central-bank funds.
The ECB’s Tone-Deaf President
Calm economic waters had given the ECB and Trichet a honeymoon until last fall.
The ECB’s policymakers are not blind, merely shortsighted.
The ECB should be preparing Europeans for what many of its own officials admit in private: Europe has not “de-coupled” from the US.
The ECB’s independence is still a contentious political issue in Europe.
The ECB’s Two Pillars - A Success
It provides a basis for the assessment of  short- to medium-term price developments. 
But the facts show otherwise.
But many advantages have already been realized.
GM crops also have significant economic benefits.
As a result, by 2007, global corn and soybean prices were nearly 6% and 10% lower, respectively, than they would have been had farmers not embraced these crops.
BRUSSELS – On a hillside overlooking the Turkish city of Gaziantep, Patriot missile launchers are keeping watch under NATO command and control.
The overall cost of piracy off the coast of Somalia in 2011 was estimated at $7 billion.
Indeed, research programs led by defense industries have already changed our lives, giving us the jet engine, the Internet, and satellite navigation.
Water Risk on the Rise
WASHINGTON, DC – Water is never far from the news these days.
Meanwhile, Central Europe faced its worst flooding in decades after heavy rains swelled major rivers like the Elbe and the Danube.
The costs are mounting.
But that has not been the case with water – until now.
They gained in every part of the country, but especially in the industrial heartland from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin.
Another important feature of the new Congress will be heightened polarization.
We are likely to see some spending consolidation, but less than in Great Britain and other European countries.
One cannot rule a country with so scant a majority.
Italy’s position today could have been much worse than it is.
The Yom Kippur War in 1973 caused a sharp increase in oil prices, leading to the global stagflation of 1974-1975.
The Iranian revolution in 1979 led to a similar stagflationary increase in oil prices, which culminated in the recession of 1980-1981.
And Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 led to a spike in oil prices at a time when a US banking crisis was already tipping America into recession.
But the time to act is now.
The stakes are high.
Of course, US policymakers have a hidden "ace in the hole."
This year, your share of the profits made by those companies will be $700.
Yet, to a remarkable degree, we have failed to do so.
Everyone extols property rights.
That “something” now usually seems to be basic political stability, preferably of the democratic kind.
There is a deep logic to this finding.
They are themselves arbitrary.
So, what does this mean for Egypt?
The Economic Governance the EU Needs
Second, all eurozone countries are effectively in the same boat.
If the boat springs a leak, everyone sinks.
Irish banks reportedly need an additional €24 billion to stay afloat.
Here, too, the Commission plays the role of neutral judge.
The Economic Imperatives of the Arab Spring
Arab students, for example, score well below average on international mathematics and science tests.
NEW YORK – We live in a time of high anxiety.
The same is true in many other places.
In this respect, the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan has been leading the way.
Here are some of the initial conclusions.
The problem is not just foods.
Back in the 1960’s, the economists William Baumol and William Bowen wrote about the “cost disease” that plagues these industries.
The example they famously used was that of a Mozart string quartet, which requires the same number of musicians and instruments in modern times as it did in the nineteenth century.
Education is clearly an area in which any country has a strong national interest in providing a level playing field.
The Economics of Strategic Containment
“Openness, freedom, transparency, and fairness have meaning far beyond the business realm,” she continued.
For the US, the eight other TPP countries, with a combined population of 200 million, constitute its fourth largest export market, behind only China, the European Union, and Japan.
There, she defines the new region of US strategic engagement as “stretching from the Indian subcontinent to the western shores of the Americas.”
Extending east from the Indian Ocean and west via the Pacific, the US is creating a new strategic framework for the twenty-first century.
CAMBRIDGE – America’s presidential election is now just six months away.
And the monthly purchasing surveys conducted by the Institute for Supply Management now indicate weaker activity among service firms as well.
The polls are very close, and voters have not yet locked in their decisions.
The Economy of Fear
What the optimists forget is that the 1950’s and 1960’s were also a period of massive insecurity.
Investors’ collective psychology is notoriously fragile.
Switzerland has been one of the richest countries in the world for a century – and not because of its natural resources.
No such relationship exists.
Does this matter, though?
The creation of more “graduate” jobs only proves that as credentials become more common, they become more important.
Today, that is becoming impossible: we are creating societies in which the sheep and the goats are marked for life in their teens.
Yet our economies still need highly trained craftspeople far more than another batch of arts graduates.
That question has provoked much debate over the years, often generating more heat than light.
Certain individuals, however, are more susceptible to the negative effects of its use.
Some studies have also explored the role of cannabis use in disorders such as depression and anxiety.
(The study has not yet been replicated.)
But, just as obviously, it is only a first step.
The Egyptian Endgame
Crowds rose against Napoleon’s French forces in 1798, against the monarchy in 1881-1882, against British dominance in 1919 and 1952, against Sadat in 1977, and against Mubarak in 1986.
These uprisings were repressed, often brutally, first by foreign troops (the French army in 1798 and British soldiers in 1882 and 1919) and more recently by the Egyptian army.
Years of fighting in Arab-Israeli conflicts, however, transformed the army, giving rise to a massive conscript force that totals approximately 400,000 soldiers today.
Today’s Egyptian army is a people’s army, and, unlike the reviled security forces, it is widely admired.
But that is not the most immediate concern.
The Eighteenth Brumaire of Arnold Schwarzenegger
Absolutely not.
So the case for representative government remains strong.
Parliaments talk before reaching conclusions; hence their name.
Anything else is likely to be about as stable as this week's top ten pop songs.
The Electronic Money Revolution
Big deal.
Electronic money is not a channel changer: as it develops, it will help transform the world economy.
But the amounts had to be cut to the size of the transaction and weighed out with balance scales.
People had to carry the scales, accompanying weights, and sometimes even tools to cut the metal, just to be able to transact.
Most people didn't have them.
With the introduction of coins, it became possible to develop many new kinds of business.
That is what people used to say years ago about cable TV.
Created in 2003, the iTunes Music Store recently surpassed its 100 millionth sale. That is certainly high volume.
Other forms will follow.
The Elephant’s Choices
India is set for more coalition rule.
Several outcomes are possible.
Congress remains a “big tent” party, committed to preserving India’s pluralism and conscious of the multiple identities and interests of India’s many peoples.
Indigenous children have a significantly lower chance of educational success.
Which policies work best?
A second option is Conditional Cash Transfer Programs, which provide cash payments to poor households whose children attend school regularly.
In Colombia, scholarships were provided to 125,000 students from poor, urban communities in the early 1990’s.
But much remains unknown.
The most expensive programs aren’t necessarily the most successful.
Merely waxing lyrical about the benefits of education will do nothing to help Latin American and Caribbean countries catch up with developed countries.
The Elusive Legacy of 1968
But, as I made clear at the time in my interview with Jean-Paul Sartre in Le Nouvel Observateur , I was only the loudspeaker for a rebellion.
The revolt was a form of political expression, but its aim was not to seize political power as such.
The desire for freedom that carried the movement forward necessarily eluded archaic modes of thinking.
For “’68” was, indeed, a rebellion joining two eras.
From the cultural point of view, we won.
So, revisit “’68”?
Indeed, some thought should be given to an exit strategy from cheap and unconditional IMF financing.
We don’t need to reinvent the wheel; we just need to follow up on the commitments made ten years ago.
So, what will they do – and, perhaps more important, what will economic forces do to them?
Indeed, a key reason for China’s slowdown in 2011-2012 is that officials wanted it.
A potential leader who deviates too much does not stay in the leadership, as we saw in 2012 with the purge of Bo Xilai.
At an even deeper and atavistic level, there is an emotional clash between a culture of fear and a culture of humiliation.
From that standpoint, the Israel-Palestine conflict is exemplary.
Here, perhaps, is the real clash of civilizations: the emotional conflict between the European culture of fear and the Muslim, particularly Arab, culture of humiliation.
And the Malaysian opposition leader Lim Kit Siang has said that Asian countries’ inaction “reflects dismally on all ASEAN leaders and governments.
Buddhism stresses compassion and mercy as much as Christianity does.
The titans of Wall Street and the City of London were exposed as hugely over-leveraged.
It continues to be a “standard setter” in a world with strong incentives to evade standards and negligible sanctions for doing so.
Meanwhile, the World Bank received an increase of 30%, while its lending arm for the poorest countries, the International Development Association, received an increase of only 18%.
The End of an Era in Finance
The only major holdout is the United States, where Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has made his distaste for the proposal clear.
To understand what Austria's government is doing, it is necessary to understand where Austria has been.
Austria's economy performed solidly throughout the 1990s, roughly in line with EU and Euro Area averages.
The first are associated with the Conservatives, the latter two with the Social Democrats.
BARCELONA ­– Are banks doomed as a result of the current financial crisis?
All this financial engineering would avoid the obsolete capital requirements that burden banks’ operation.
The current crisis killed off  this optimistic scenario.
This is a textbook market failure.
Northern Rock in the United Kingdom has been a victim of this modern banking strategy, as has Bear Stearns in the United States.
America’s Bond-Market Blues
This, in turn, has fueled a roughly 28% annual expansion in China’s foreign-exchange reserves.
That may all be about to change.
It didn’t work.
The constraints for eurozone countries are similar to those of a state in America that gets into fiscal trouble.
This means that state fiscal behavior tends to be pro-cyclical in the face of large shocks like the recent one.
The other is labor mobility.
The current crisis vividly underscores the point.
The End of Green Ideology
After all, the Fukushima accident has severely injured only a few people – probably less than a dozen workers are dangerously irradiated.
Japan will not stop using nuclear power.
A wind turbine requires 50 tons of steel and half a square mile of ground space.
If California were to rely on solar power for its electricity consumption, the entire state would have to be covered with photovoltaic cells.
Such a renewed energy balance would impact the current global balance of power.
They illustrate the catalytic effect of digital connectivity (clearly visible, too, among China’s “twittering classes”).
Although I knew December 7, 2001 marked its 60 th anniversary, I never imagined that the phrase ``Pearl Harbor '' would be heard so often this year.
Its repetition began in a prosaic way, with the release of the Disney movie ``Pearl Harbor'' last June.
Some of the concepts the Constitution contained were so alien to Japanese tradition that new ideograms had to be created to express them.
This was why Japan did not send the SDF to the Gulf.
The End of Nuclear Power
The exact opposite is occurring with renewables.
But is it really true that a renewable power system is impossible?
In both economic and ethical terms, nuclear power merits no role.
The End of Physics?
When communism collapsed, people spoke of the "End of History."
Some now speak in a similar way of the "End of Physics."
Questions about the end of physics are not new.
Radioactivity, x-rays and the discovery of the electron opened up a new world.
Stars, galaxies, the evolution of the universe as well as biological entities such as proteins, cells and genes all came under the purview of physics.
With this record of advance behind it, what remains for physics to achieve?
How does the universe work?
Our ambition is to find an answer so elegant and simple that it will fit easily on the front of a T-shirt.
Why is the "Standard Model" flawed?
Will this knowledge hijack emotion, love, music, poetry, art?
NEW DELHI – According to the United Nations’ Population Division, the world’s human population hit seven billion on October 31.
The future we face is not one of too much population growth, but too little.
What demographers call the Total Fertility Rate is the average number of live births per woman over her lifetime.
The TFR for most developed countries now stands well below replacement levels.
However, the biggest TFR declines in recent years have been in developing countries.
Compare this to the natural ratio of 105 boys per 100 girls.
The End of Russia\u0027s Second Revolution
MOSCOW: Sooner or later, all revolutions end.
That agreement matters.
President Putin’s moves to strengthen an integrated power system are therefore logical and correct.
Christian fundamentalism in the United States has come to dominate large segments of the Republican Party.
The End of South Africa’s Honeymoon
Domestic problems and regional instability mean foreign policy is becoming an increasingly rocky road for the ruling African National Congress (ANC) government of President Thabo Mbeki.
I say yes – and no – to this proposition.
Friedman would respond that, given the state of the world in 1975, a move in the direction of his principles was a big improvement.
The End of the Beginning of Ending Poverty
It has been exploring new ways of “delivering” aid, sometimes using state and local governments where that appears more effective.
In one village, a bridge was built to connect two neighborhoods separated during the rainy season.
For instance, children who live on one side of the river can now attend school on the other side during the rainy season.
On this, the IMF is partly right.
Global support for “making poverty history” shows how the issue of Third-World poverty has finally struck a responsive chord.
The Bank of Japan has twice lowered its interest rate, which now stands at 0.1%. And the Bank of England has cut its benchmark rate nine times, by 525 points, to an all-time low of 0.5%.
As a recent report by the international consultancy McKinsey &amp; Company argues, the next decade will witness rising interest rates worldwide amid global economic rebalancing.
The End of the End of History
Insofar as it remained committed to Marxist ideology, the long-term goal of the Soviet regime was world communism.
Marxism is a version of economic determinism.
Guided by these beliefs, the Soviet state waged an incessant war on the national and religious traditions of the peoples they governed.
Today, the global free market constructed in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse is also falling apart--and for similar reasons.
Russia at the time of communism's fall was a militarized rust-belt, but the IMF was convinced that it could be transformed into a western-style market economy.
It is because it no longer suits the countries that most actively promote it.
Many of these highly indebted governments have large stocks of gold, which they may decide to dump to reduce their debts.
A currency serves three functions, providing a means of payment, a unit of account, and a store of value.
Nor is it a unit of account; prices of goods and services, and of financial assets, are not denominated in gold terms.
The End of the Monroe Doctrine
The Monroe Doctrine – which in 1823 proclaimed all of Latin America to be a zone of exclusive American interest – is withering away.
Iran, too, has joined the game.
It is working hard to strengthen ties to South and Central America, both diplomatically and through energy politics.
Even Japan is devoting more attention to the region.
Russia may be experiencing a global “restoration” phase, but in politics and economics, and also with respect to its empire, restoration is headed in the wrong direction.
The End of the Special Relationship?
Obama is a revolutionary phenomenon in American history; he certainly does not fit the traditional pattern of American presidents after World War II.
A Spanish bank run, financial crash, and euro exit follow in short order.
A remote scenario?
Perhaps, but not remote enough.
They fight in armies, pay their taxes, and vote in elections.
Some history may help here.
As originally defined by Parliament in 14 th century England, the Anglo-American version of treason includes a whole range of acts that threatened the Crown.
To even think of murdering the King (then quaintly called ``compassing'') was punishable by death.
To be a traitor you must first have a duty to be loyal.
The French have no such duty toward the English Crown.
Only the English do.
Witness the debate about whether or not to prosecute John Walker, the Californian who fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Yet Americans seem reluctant to brand him a traitor.
When a group of dissident Jews conspired in 1970 to highjack an airplane, they were charged with attempted treason.
Two of the organizers were sentenced to death.
The story in the Czech Republic differs.
But things are more complicated than that.
Hitler changed the law in 1934 in the megalomaniac belief that the whole world owed him a duty of loyalty.
Even though the label of treason is used, the offense now resembles the American concept of sedition and seeks to prevent a violent overthrow of the government.
The End of Want?
And India?
Now the world of 2050 will not be a paradise.
But we have good reason to hope that there will be fewer of them.
The economy is the realm of things that have value.
All US troops are due to leave Iraq by the end of 2011.&#160;
Iran will continue to enrich uranium regardless of whether a Republican or a Democrat is America’s president.
Moreover, Iran’s leaders remember that the Shah was forced to flee the country in 1979, despite having strong international support.
In terms of policy, there was a promising effort in the late 1970’s.
Fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles were legislated, and car producers implemented them.
Now these policies have to be reversed, which implies similar political challenges and costs.
The question is when.
The People's Republic of China is a country in precarious transition from one political/ economic system to another.
The Entrepreneurial University
by Henry Etzkowitz  By Henry Etzkowitz 
As this occurs, attitudes will once again be modified and opposition will dissipate. 
Licensing, joint ventures, and the marketing of products that result from research offer additional avenues for wide dissemination of new knowledge, above and beyond publication. 
Governments are not organized to meet them.
Its seven million people cannot survive without a new approach that gives them a chance to grow crops and water their animals.
The United States faces risks as well.
The Environment of the Economy
No economy is a closed, autonomous universe, governed by rules independent from law, morals, and politics.
Indeed, the most interesting economic questions are generally located on the borderline with neighboring disciplines.
We cannot impose an ecological rhythm on people who are poorer than we are when it is the very fact that we freed ourselves from that rhythm that made us richer.
Yet nature, like knowledge, is a public good that needs state intervention to be “produced” in sufficient quantities.
What is going on here?
The Commission’s approach is misguided.
Latvia’s example is the most acute.
Starting almost from an economic “point zero,” Latvian entrepreneurs have built a new and modern economy, based on new and efficient technologies.
In small economies such as Latvia and many of the other new member states, even one large project is important for the whole country’s progress.
Why are Latvia’s people, among the poorest in the Union, expected to pay for something that Europe’s richest people are finding difficult to do?
But man was not alone in feeling the impact.
Ecosystems and other species were also hit.
Tsunamis may make small, low islands uninhabitable.
But this is a comparatively small problem.
Along the coast of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, some 30% of the fishery capacity was lost.
Mozambique, Somalia, and Tanzania on the African side of the Indian Ocean have also reported severe damage to their fishing. 
The Environmental Effects of the Iraq War
In fact, US and British troops may have only themselves to blame.
Under the crust, the sand particles are loose.
In the first Gulf war, this resulted in "rolling" sand dunes, sometimes ten meters high and several kilometers long, that covered roads and buildings.
Finer particles became airborne and caused environmental and health problems across northeastern Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and southwestern Iraq.
When destroyed, such as on the road north from Kuwait City, the PCBs leaked into the ground.
For now, limited information makes any accurate assessment impossible.
The Error of the War on Terror
None of the six points was implemented.
They are wrong.
The political--as distinct from the military-- wing of Hamas must be responsive to their desires.
Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that, by hook or by crook, Putin will spend six more years as Russia’s ruler.
What will another Putin presidency mean for Russia?
He no longer understands the problems facing the country, and therefore has no idea what needs to be done.
The Eternal Putin
But contempt for democracy has been Putin’s stock-in-trade ever since he arrived in the Kremlin from Saint Petersburg two decades ago.
If they could export them, they would be as rich as Germans.
This partly explains enduring popular devotion to rulers like Joseph Stalin.
That remains true today.
After 12 years in power, and grasping for 12 more, Putin can no longer sustain the pretense of adhering to democracy and promoting modernization.
The Eternal Wall
They had underestimated the strength of “German national feeling” in the East. And they grossly overestimated the Soviet Union’s ability and will to keep its empire at all costs.
The miracle of today’s reunified Berlin is a challenge – even a provocation – to all walls.
It is proof that in a globally interdependent world, walls are unnatural and artificial – and thus doomed.
There, empty windows filled with sandbags continue to face each other defiantly, symbols of a past that has not passed for decades.
Are Greek Cypriots seriously interested in reunifying their island?
Most likely, they do not.
The Ethanol Hunger
WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA – Food prices have in many cases surpassed the peak levels reached in July 2008.
With more income at their disposal, people begin to consume more of their food basket in the form of animal products.
Producing these animal products requires significantly more agricultural resources than a predominantly plant-based diet.
In the US, government policy mandates 48 billion liters of ethanol in 2011.
Stocks-to-use ratios are a primary driver of commodity prices, because they give us an indication of the cushion that we have for shortfalls somewhere in the world.
In many other regions, these gaps are 40-60%.
The bottom line is that there is huge potential to increase production in many parts of Eastern Europe, Africa, and South America.
Our proposal what we need for a code and for its contents have both met with strongly conflicting views.
In our  Science article, we speculated on scientists’ reasons for holding such a view.
Society has entrusted scientists and scientific institutions to show respect for life, in particular human life.
The taboo is the companion to the sacred: that which we regard as sacred we protect with taboos.
It is very important that newcomers take their place in queues whether it is for a bus or a cup of tea.”
While this might sound like an excerpt from a Monty Python sketch, it raises an important issue: should there be limits as to what prospective citizens are tested for?
Can testing become counter-productive?
If that were true, “progressive legislation” would inevitably be a contradiction in terms.
The Ethics of Eating
To prevent this, producers sear off all birds’ beaks with a hot blade.
When foraging in a rural village, they can exercise that intelligence and explore their varied environment.
Before they give birth, sows use straw or leaves and twigs to build a comfortable and safe nest in which to nurse their litter.
They lie on bare concrete without straw or any other form of bedding.
The EU, Serbia, and the Balkans
Today, they have that new start.
The EU’s record is clear.
But it did, in the Balkans.
All Europe’s demons had not been exorcised.
We doubled – to 20 million euros – the EU’s assistance to Montenegro this year.
The European Commission pledged 530 million euros for projects under the Quick Start package.
Eighteen months after the air strikes in Kosovo, we are making headway.
Here Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen offers his hopes for what type of treaty will emerge.
That is the task of the Intergovernmental Conference, which started its work on October 4th.
Denmark's priorities are clear.
The purpose of the European Council Chair is to ensure the coherence and decision-making capacity of the European Council.
On paper, the EU effort looks impressive.
Such a bargain must contain two elements.
Romania is due to end its membership negotiations with the EU in 2004.
Unfortunately, in terms of the European Commission, nothing is less "European" than this porcine hecatomb.
Everything should be supervised by vets.
In America, I am told, a slang word for the police is "pigs."
Our ruling social democratic party has its stronghold in Romania's rural areas.
This is a nightmare that both European and mainstream Romanian politicians want to avoid.
A Green European Budget
Other post-Soviet countries are also experiencing internal pressure to re-orient themselves towards Russia and feel abandoned by the EU.
Both countries suffer from Russian trade embargoes on their most important export products – wines and foodstuffs.
The EU\u0027s Catch-22
Costs, of course, are not the only difficulty.
That’s "Catch-22".
Economics are the means, politics the purpose.
One corner of Europe is in particular need of prompt action: the Baltic Sea Region.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania cannot join NATO for the foreseeable future.
There would be no room left for adventures on either side.
The EU’s Global Mission
The EU has realized that dream.
The second value is social justice.
As individuals, we are part of an ever-widening circle of communities, and we can realize our potential only if we live in harmony with each other.
Fine distinctions are made, for example, between the rights of citizens and non-citizens.
Another world is possible.
But it is up to Europe to take the lead in achieving it.
The EU’s Hour, or Europe’s Darkest Hour?
Emotions and expectations ran high when the new democracies from the former East Bloc joined the EU only five years ago.
Some of these democracies are very young and fragile.
So this must be the hour of Europe.
We will find common European solutions.
The EU\u0027s Istanbul Train
Energy, transport infrastructure – roads, railways, and waterways – and crime prevention have all benefited.
What about today?
It is in Europe’s interest as much as it is in the interest of the region to accelerate the integration process.
The EU’s Looming Crisis over Cyprus
Ten new members, from Central Europe and the Mediterranean, will be admitted in 2004.
Second, the international context in which the EU operates is being transformed by the strategic revolution underway in Washington.
Otherwise, it is difficult to imagine further EU enlargement.
But it takes two to tango.
This is particularly visible in the banking sector.
They are, instead, effectively borrowing in a “foreign” currency (or, rather, a currency that they cannot individually control).
But it was.
And this concentration of public debt on banks’ balance sheets is what makes the entire European banking system so vulnerable to a sovereign default.
This is a mistake.
The EU’s Small Leaders
First, there had already been a substantial flow of workers before enlargement.
They are more keenly aware that if they try to redistribute too much, they will simply drive away the factors of production: capital will flow elsewhere, and labor will likewise migrate.
The result is that they are feeling less French or German, creating greater political room, on both the left and the right, for nationalist ressentiment.
But since 1989 – or since the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1992 – the political dynamic has changed.
It is now the EU’s smaller states that gain the most from wider and deeper European integration.
The EU’s Turn in Afghanistan
The NATO summit in Riga of November 28-29 may be the last chance to pull that country back from the brink.
Some, like Macedonia and Finland, belong to the Alliance’s Partnership for Peace.
Others, like Australia and South Korea, come from farther afield.
One or two EU countries might object that this would mix institutional apples and oranges.
The EU’s Viennese Mirror
The Hapsburg Empire acted as a stabilizing force for its peoples and for Europe.
The heart of the problem was the 1867 Compromise, which divided the empire into Austrian and Hungarian halves.
So ended the first European union.
On both counts, the EU confronted challenges in 2007 much like those confronting Austria-Hungary in 1907.
In a union of many parts, there are no shortcuts: the EU must provide the same level of integration at the periphery as at the imperial core.
The shared steel initiative of 1952 could find its parallel in a German-Polish initiative to jointly manage natural gas imports.
This means, above all, establishing a united voice on energy.
So, during the course of 2009, the EU sent election observation missions to various countries, including Mozambique, Afghanistan, Guinea Bissau, Lebanon, Malawi, and Bolivia.
All of this is happening not in some remote country, far removed from civilization.
High levels of debt combine with slow economic growth in a devilish dance.
But, so far, that gamble isn’t working as well or as rapidly as hoped.
The Euro at Mid-Crisis
That is nonsense.
As any recovering alcoholic could tell them, the first step is admitting, with Merkel, that Europe has a problem.
The Euro at Ten
What, then, of the costs?
Will the euro’s second decade be as successful as the first?
Countries cannot run out of liquidity, because the ECB can always provide more cash.
Second, financial markets have become huge relative to anything seen under the gold standard.
These countries may eventually decide to leave.
The euro system was designed to deliver prosperity and stability for all.
There is a lot of shouting in the jury room.
Ten years later, where do we stand?
The story is markedly different in other eurozone members.
With this artificial boost to their economic growth, they had little incentive to press ahead with unpopular reforms in line with the European Union’s Lisbon agenda.
Then came the global crisis.
The Euro Grows Up
On January 1, the euro celebrated its sixth birthday.
This is a remarkable achievement.
Would it be compatible with autonomous national fiscal policies?
Another period of excessive pessimism arose a year ago.
This medium-term orientation paid off.
Several lessons can be learned from these episodes.
The Euro in a Shrinking Zone
One person’s spending is another person’s income.
Two policies that might, in combination, save it are off the agenda.
The only question is the scale, timing, and manner of its breakup.
In 1999, the difference between the euro-zone countries with the lowest and highest inflation rate was two percentage points.
By 2009, it had increased to six percentage points.
Despite the most severe financial and economic crisis in almost a century, the Finnish national debt actually decreased by 2009, to 39.7%.
If it hikes the interest rate, the southern euro-zone countries will complain.
Almost 20 years later, the Swedish band Europe’s hit song, “The Final Countdown,” seems more appropriate for the euro area with every passing day.
The Euro’s Greek Tragedy
Germany and Austria behaved the same way.
In other words, Greece qualified only by cheating.
Like Greece, Italy was admitted to the euro zone despite being light-years away from meeting all the criteria.
That alone yielded a windfall of tens of billions of euros per year.
What if Greece gets into so much trouble that it cannot service its debt?
That is not impossible.
Current European rules prohibit other European countries or the EU itself from helping Greece.
The Euro’s Imagined Community
That must not happen.
None of us can foresee what the consequences would be if we were to fail.”
There is a European Union flag, but it is rarely seen anywhere but outside of EU government buildings.
For example, there could be a Greek euro, a Spanish euro, etc.
The notes could even show the same pictures of bridges.
But what is missing from the agreement is even more significant than what is there.
Yet little was done.
Politically and economically, it came with the best intentions.
But details matter.
Europe has great strengths.
The Euro’s PIG-Headed Masters
CAMBRIDGE – Europe is in constitutional crisis.
Unfortunately, they are not just “kicking the can down the road,” but pushing a snowball down a mountain.
CAMBRIDGE: The script for the euro has become pure improvisation.
Europe's great political project - the EU - now had an equal economic project.
Daily, the euro sinks.
But that is where we may be heading.
All this is happening as Europe approaches the introduction of real euro notes in January 2002.
- Who is to blame?
The world has too many currency choices.
The euro has not necessarily reached the bottom.
More likely, the euro will stabilize at some point in the range of 80 US cents, then begin to climb back up.
The foreign borrowing of Kazakh banks amounted to around 50% of GDP, with many of these funds used for construction projects.
Ireland, Europe’s (Celtic) tiger over the last decade, grew in part due to large credit inflows into its “Banking Real Estate Complex.”
When the world economy dove in 2008-2009, Ireland’s party was also over.
But here’s where the stories diverge, at least so far.
The Europe of the Future
Today, however, Europe is faced with a new global economy, reconfigured by globalization and by the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America.
This approach nonetheless has clearly defined limits.
What might it look like?
Mine are the personal views of a European citizen.
The future of Europe is in the hands of its democracies, in the hands of Europe’s people.
They are the masters.
These are Europe’s roots.
So, today, we should not look back.
The European Consequences of Germany’s Election
From this perspective, Western Europe appears to have at least as good a claim to the title of "Good Society" as does the US.
The European Museum
A prominent Chinese businessman who divides his time between Hong-Kong and London was even more specific.
The European Union\u0027s Battle for Turkey
But Turkey is different.
Nor should they be.
This suggests that a better question is whether to introduce the Volcker rule in addition to, rather than instead of, ring-fencing.
The Europeanization of Russia
For the first time since communism's collapse, Russia can formulate its own long-term development path - one with defined criteria for appraising policy decisions.
Third, the legal and technical parameters of the proposed Common European Economic Area remain vague.
But a precedent exists: the European Economic Area (EAA), which incorporates EU countries along with Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.
Moreover, unemployment benefits are not as important as is often assumed.
For example, the local real-estate boom and bust in Nevada was as severe as that in Spain or Ireland.
For Nevada, such support can be estimated at 10-20% of its “national” income.
The figure relates the inflation rate during the second half of 2010 to the relative importance of imports from China.
Notes: The Q3/Q4 inflation rate is the annualized percentage change of the Harmonized Consumer Price Index from 15.06.2010 to 15.12.2010 (15.05-15.11 for Ireland).
It is also heavily indebted, but in domestic currency.
The alternative conception assumes that the eurozone is a group of individual countries within a common currency area.
Clearly, to paraphrase Robert Frost, the road taken will make all the difference.
For that reason, the euro’s fate lies not in Athens, or in Rome, but at the ECB’s headquarters in Frankfurt.
The Eurozone’s Last Stand
More Leadership for More Europe
It was already evident when the Maastricht
A monetary union that does not benefit all of its participants will not survive for long.
The ECB must become a genuine central bank for Europe.
The European banking system must be turned into a banking union with the ECB responsible for prudential supervision.
Skeptics have plenty of ammunition for their critique of the euro.
For a day, or sometimes only for a few hours, traders succumb to the illusion of stability, fueling a euphoric but ephemeral financial-market rally.
All manner of new legal and constitutional difficulties constantly arise.
Is an amendment to the EU treaty required?
But the persistence of these difficulties sheds light on why the eurozone was established in the first place.
Whenever the dollar was weak, capital surged into alternative currencies, notably the Japanese yen and the German Mark.
The Central Bank of the Netherlands expects Dutch GDP to shrink by -0.5% this year –&#160;following a contraction of about 1% in 2012.
The eurozone crisis may be entering its third stage.
In the first stage, beginning in the spring of 2008, the locus of the North Atlantic crisis moved from the United States to the eurozone.
That assumption appeared plausible.
The Dutch economy’s poor prospects are similarly alarming.
Things will begin to look up in the second half of 2013, we are told.
What's new this time is that the current storm came out of the blue.
Last year, Russia's Patriarch Aleksei gave his blessing to a visit to Moscow by the Catholic girls' choir of the Saint Danilov monastery.
A Roman Catholic arch-diocese (headed by either a Cardinal or Archbishop) was to be created for Moscow.
Four other apostolic districts in Russia were to be turned into dioceses.
Soon after, Cardinal Kasper's visit was canceled.
This was accomplished through a televised transmission which connected the Apostolic Palace of the Vatican with the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Moscow.
The Pope will be invited as a head of state (the Vatican) not in his spiritual capacity.
First, because the next pope will almost certainly not be Polish - indeed, is unlikely to be any sort of Slav.
Moreover, although younger than John Paul II, Patriarch Aleksey II has entered his own ``autumn of the patriarch.''
But where has that process led, where is it taking us now, and, perhaps most importantly, how can we influence its course?
But this middle-income transition is sometimes deemed a trap.
What is the impact on a large advanced country like the United States?
One problem with this view is that it cannot account for the stark differences between the US and Japan, Germany, and South Korea.
The focus on currencies as a cause of the West’s economic woes, while not entirely misplaced, has been excessive.
The good news is that, at a deep level, incentives across advanced and developing countries are aligned.
France and Germany used to be in the forefront of the effort.
This stance led to a dramatic acceleration in European integration, culminating in the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the introduction of the euro in 1999.
The setting differs, but the effect is the same.
The Endangered Arab Christian
All of this sends a clear message: non-Muslims are not safe in Libya.
At least two died and 80 were injured in the five-hour clash.
Ultimately, Christians and Muslims in the Arab world have the same desires: freedom, dignity, and equal rights.
The Extinction Puzzle
For every one of the world’s 10,000 bird species, there may be 10 or perhaps even 100 other unknown species of animals, plants, or fungi.
Birds’ popularity means that they provide an unrivaled source of information about which species live where and how well those species are doing.
For example, parrots, rails, and doves once occured across the Pacific on sufficiently large islands.
Those islands that have been well explored archaeologically yield bones of species the Polynesians exterminated, while the islands now lack them.
These searches are far from complete.
Whereas bird taxonomists had described only 2,000 bird species by 1815, in the next 50 years they described about 5,000 more.
We added species that are probably extinct, too.
Tropical forests, for example, hold the majority of bird species – and likely most other kinds of species too.
Certainly, some other species also benefit from the protections that we afford birds, but many other species do not.
Moreover, human actions threaten substantially higher proportions of other well-known groups – such as flowering plants and amphibians.
The Face of Evil
They left their twin Mercedes and, in fading light, started toward us.
I felt a jolt go through my body; they were unmistakable.
It was 5 p.m. on September 13, 1995, during the height of the war in Bosnia.
(Milosevic was not to be indicted until 1999.)
Karadzic was silent at first.
Milosevic said something to Karadzic in Serbian; he sat down again, and the meeting got down to business.
The next day, we were able to fly into the reopened airfield in Sarajevo.
Two months later, the war would end at Dayton, never to resume.
Finally, one of these dreadful murderers is in The Hague.
In the early 1980’s, they fell under the spell of monetarism, a simplistic economic theory promoted by Milton Friedman.
The cure would be worse than the disease.
And if the decline in nominal wages signals that there is an excess supply of labor, matters only get worse.
But an effective rescue cannot be done any other way.
And that, unfortunately, is the perception held by many nowadays, particularly in the United States.
The Fall of France
Chirac, Georges Pompidou's agriculture minister in the 1970's, wants to keep the CAP as it is.
France was a core part of Europe when the Union had only six members and reflected the primary goal of Franco-German reconciliation.
The fall of the Berlin Wall changed all that.
But French ideas are not necessarily central to a Europe no longer driven by the Franco-German engine.
France remains a major European country: it is a founder of the Union, one of the world's richest nations, and holds a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.
Here I have no confidence in Jacques Chirac.
The Fall of the House of Murdoch
A cover-up ensued.
Millions of in-house emails reportedly have been destroyed.
This is News Corporation’s main face in the US, in the form of Fox News, whose hallmark has been relentless propagation of right-wing ideology.
All of this is far removed from what a journalistic organization is supposed to do.
The News Corporation seems determined to take Britain and the US down a similar path.
But now, at least in Britain, the political class is in revolt.
Israelis are rediscovering Europe.
Europe and Russia no longer see themselves as secondary players, because the US, not to mention Israel, needs them.
Recently, a high South Korean official listed in hierarchical order the countries that mattered most in the North Korean nuclear crisis.
China came first, followed by the US, Russia, Japan, and South Korea, whereas Europe was absent.
These are only a few signs among many others.
Of course, one should not “bury” the US too soon.
The common good is not their cup of tea.
They have too much to catch up with, in terms of national ego and national interest, to care for others.
It is the EU that can make multi-polarity work if it plays its role positively.
The Fall of the UN
In a fitting irony, the United Nations is going down with him.
The looming chatterbox on New York's East River will also continue to bleat.
History suggests not.
Iraq was such a state, but there are others.
The Fallen Pharaoh
But the most dramatic part of the book concerns Mubarak himself.
Anyone who stands in their way, according to the report, can be thrown into prison on false charges of drug dealing.
The regime may respond by trying to tighten the noose.
On a real trade-weighted basis, the dollar is down about 13% relative to its value in March 2006.
Unfortunately, the facts say otherwise.
In reality, it will likely be 14.5%.
Compared to 250 years ago, the average person in the United Kingdom today has access to 50 times more power, travels 250 times farther, and has 37,500 times more light.
Since 1990, wind-generated power has grown 26% per year and solar a phenomenal 48%.
But the growth has been from almost nothing to slightly more than almost nothing.
In 1990, wind produced 0.0038% of the world’s energy; it is now producing 0.29%.
But electricity accounts for only 18% of its final energy use.
Europe now gets 1% of its energy from wind – less than before industrialization, when cozy windmills contributed about 2% (and ships’ sails provided another 1%).
Current green energy policies are failing for a simple reason: renewables are far too expensive.
Wind makes up just 0.2% of China’s energy, and solar accounts for 0.01%.
It needs no subsidies, and it produces 50 times more energy than all of China’s solar panels.
That shift is understandable.
They allow the White House to argue that it means to undermine Iran’s leadership, not its people.
They must realize that government will not ride to their rescue.
What would the G-8 leaders do, station troops in Africa to seize coffee beans and peanuts?
Debt collection from poor nations is an absurdity, now and into the distant future.
Third-world debt burdens are little more than a scorecard for past development failures.
President Barack Obama has likewise promised a million electric cars in the United States – but five years sooner.
For the world’s most popular electric car, the Nissan Leaf, this exemption is worth €63,000.
Yet this is clearly not enough.
In Denmark, there are still only 1,224 electric cars.
In Germany, car sales totaled 3.2 million in 2011, but only 2,154 were electric.
They are often sold as “zero emissions” vehicles, but that is true only when they are moving.
But its battery will likely need to be replaced long before it reaches this target, implying many more tons of CO2 emissions.
In fact, such distances seem implausible, given electric cars’ poor range: the Nissan Leaf, for example, can go only 117 kilometers on a charge.
If the car is driven less than 50,000 kilometers on European electricity, it will have emitted more CO2 overall than a conventional car.
Even if driven much farther, 150,000 kilometers, an electric car’s CO2 emissions will be only 28% less than those of a gasoline-powered car.
Financial globalization is a recent phenomenon.
One could trace its beginnings to the 1970’s, when recycled petrodollars fueled large capital inflows to developing nations.
But things have not worked out according to plan.
Most likely, the real constraint lies on the investment side.
That is a question all of us should consider.
The increased focus on improving corporate governance has produced a demand for reliable standards for evaluating governance in publicly traded companies worldwide.
The notion of a single set of criteria to evaluate the governance of publicly traded firms worldwide is undoubtedly appealing.
Both investors and publicly traded firms are operating in increasingly integrated global capital markets.
Social welfare systems are shaking as never before. Not only in Europe, but in parts of North and South America, and Asia as well.
What is the most effective method?
Today, the risks are seen to be much greater, and the benefits are seen to be less.
If the private market has the flexibility of two hands, government bureaucracy has at best two thumbs.
Here are three:
But in a downturn tax revenues fall.
They speak clearly and offer banalities while exchanging notes under the table.
Moreover, information never comes without interpretation.
The installation of the webcams was an act of simultaneous transparency and conspiracy.
Such an event occurred in December in Rome.
The next step will be to confirm this change in June 2013 at the FAO Conference, in which all FAO member countries participate.
This should be a top priority for governments and a goal embraced by citizens everywhere.
Now is the time.
VIENNA – Negotiations at the United Nations High Level Summit on drugs in Vienna last week fell flat.
The list goes on.
A Death in Galway
Halappanavar suffered extreme pain on October 21.
But Halappanavar and her husband were then informed that Ireland is a Catholic country; the fetus still had a heartbeat, so the procedure was out of the question.
Hindu medical ethics calls for ahimsa, or “non-harming”; that is, a doctor’s duty is to do the least harm possible in the situation.
In this respect, Hinduism resembles Judaism, even Orthodox Judaism, in which “the mother’s life is more important than that of the fetus.”
In turn, many Chinese fear that the United States will not accept their “peaceful rise.”
Today, the greatest prospect of a destabilizing incident lies in the complex relationships across the Taiwan Strait.
The two sides in Taiwan will face off in a presidential election on March 22.
The US-Japan security alliance means China cannot play a “Japan card.”
The environment of fear that arises has little to do with bad government policies, although bad policy may exacerbate the situation.
We need not tolerate 9% unemployment as the new normal.
And children will be placed most at risk of profound negative effects.
Two states, New Jersey and Idaho, recently introduced legislation to seek to opt out of the new policy.
PARIS – In May 1981, Pope John Paul II survived an assassination attempt.
The list seems endless.
In the same vein, we will have the “other” we deserve.
The Fed vs. the Financiers
In short, no central banker can be the Oracle of Delphi.
China’s statistical agency is still mired in communist input-output accounting.
Even inflation can be very hard to measure precisely.
This is why central bankers must think about the information embedded in asset prices.
This is dangerous territory.
I share this consensus view.
The problem is how to establish two different types of accountability for two different functions.
There is bound to be some contagion from one function to another.
The Continental Congress did well when, in 1775, it asked George Washington to lead the forces then gathering in rebellion against the British.
But that would not be the worst of the danger.
In the previous tightening cycle, which began in 2004, it took the Fed two years to normalize the policy rate.
We know how that movie ended, and we may be poised for a sequel.
That is why good monetary policy aims to prevent bubbles from arising.
One way is as part of America’s strategy of competitive devaluation.
But potentially significant costs offset these small benefits.
The Fight for Food
Insufficient nourishment impedes their capacity to learn, fitness to work, and ability to develop their talents.
Fighting malnutrition is the first step toward reaching this objective.
The Fight for Pakistan’s Soul
Then, Mohammad was interviewed on GEO TV, where he explained his political views.
The answer to that question lies within the various Muslim communities of the region, not just in Pakistan.
Afghanistan faces an election later this year.
To a large degree, Pakistan’s relations with India, Afghanistan, and the United States depend on the military.
But the army must accept its subservience to Pakistan’s political leadership.
Talibanization gains ground when people lose faith in the capacity of the modern state to improve their lives.
One example is the Media/Most group which, for reasons unknown, was financed by Gazprom to the tune of more than half a billion dollars!
But secret deals with Media/Most are but the tip of the iceberg.
To no avail.
Despite this, Gazprom’s holding company appears to be rolling in cash while its production subsidiaries mostly appear bankrupt and never pay their taxes in full.
He should pick up the phone and fire managers who compromise Russia.
This would be the clearest sign of his intention to put reform on the right track.
Some 6.3 billion people now live on Earth.
But population may well decline thereafter.
They are right.
Some need to export steel. Others will have to export furniture or textiles.
Still others will have to export citrus, grains, processed foods, etc.
Perhaps Malthus will rule again, in geographically small but densely populated and immensely poor parts of the globe.
The world today is too small for any of us to be able to afford for any corner of it to be left out of the conquest of Malthusianism.
The Financial Crisis One Year After
NEW YORK – It is now almost a year since the world economy teetered on the edge of calamity.
In short, the US stimulus effects on spending have probably been positive but small, and without a decisive effect on the economy.
In fact, seizing this opportunity is the only recipe for genuine growth that we have left.
LOS ANGELES – A few weeks ago, the world was on the edge of disaster.
The situation in these countries is so serious that a few days ago the United States granted them credit for up to $60 billion.
Indeed, with the recession possibly lasting 18 months or more – which would make it the longest since World War II – Argentina will be one of the hardest hit.
Mexico and Central America will also suffer from the long recession.
For many years, their economic fate has been closely tied to that of the US.
But the most important question is what will happen in Brazil, Latin America’s giant.
The Fire Next Time
Haiti, once again, is ablaze.
I visited President Aristide in Port-au-Prince in early 2001.
Life expectancy was 52 years.
Of every 1000 children born, more than 100 died before their 5th birthday.
The US position was a travesty.
That chaos has now come.
It is sad to hear rampaging students on BBC and CNN saying that Aristide "lied" because he didn't improve the country's social conditions.
The lies came from Washington.
The Fiscal Crisis Down Below
Health care for the poor (Medicaid) is a shared responsibility.
US Supreme Court Judge Louis Brandeis famously argued for “the states as laboratories.”
As with competition in private markets, competition in government services leads to better outcomes.
There are important differences among jurisdictions.
But California’s unemployment rate, 12.3% in November 2009, was tied for the nation’s third highest.
Unless the US can get its fiscal house in order, it will be forced to abdicate leadership on a wide range of critical global issues.
The Fish that Shrank
But today you would be lucky to find a cod that weighs more than two kilograms.
But several roadblocks still stand in the way, making it very difficult for the joint AU-UN mission to bring about a peaceful settlement to the Darfur conflict.
The Flight to Quality
How much should they do?
The Fog of Finance
Military leaders talk about the “fog of war” – the condition of fundamental uncertainty that marks combat.
The central banker is not only a lender of last resort, but also a speaker of last resort.
Now it will be forced to do so.
How victims remember trauma is the most controversial issue facing psychology and psychiatry today.
Indeed, the mind does not operate like a video recorder, and thus not every aspect of a traumatic experience gets encoded into memory in the first place.
Sexual abuse is not invariably traumatic in the sense of being overwhelmingly terrifying.
In the east, there was a strong sense of being Bengali, and a sizeable Hindu minority continued to live in the province.
And, as Bengali demands for autonomy gained momentum, the response became more repressive.
Yahya Khan responded by sending in the troops.
Dhaka University’s residential halls were particularly targeted.
Up to 700 students were killed in a single attack on Jagannath Hall.
Hundreds of thousands of women were systematically raped in the countryside.
He would even send the US Seventh Fleet to cow her.
With support from the civilian population, as well as from the Mukti Bahini, an irregular army of Bengali rebels, the Indian army swept into East Pakistan.
Bangladesh was born.
It is as if the Nuremberg trials never happened after WWII.
The Forgotten Sick
These threats emerge frequently and unpredictably from human contact with animals.
Blood loss, causing anemia, is the result of thousands of worms chewing at the wall of the gut.
Guinea disease is now endemic in only four countries, and leprosy is a problem in only six.
The poor countries argue that broader liberalization in the EU, the US, and Japan alone would yield benefits worth up to $142 billion by 2015.
The Forgotten Twentieth-Century
So how should we think about the ideological legacy of the twentieth century?
This is not to make any excuses – it is not true that to comprehend is to forgive.
And virtually all Central and Eastern European countries adopted it after 1989.
That discussion has barely begun.
The Forgotten Virtues of Free Trade
Protectionism is bad for wealth, bad for democracy, and bad for peace.
It requires democratic reform from the bottom up.
Bretton Woods and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade created a new order after the Second World War.
The Fountain of Youth Revealed
Applying this knowledge could be close behind. 
These primitive life forms have yielded important, generally valid clues that have forced a comprehensive re-evaluation of the nature of the aging process. 
The answer can be found by examining the molecules that make up the genes in which mutations extend life span.
Conversely, if the SIR2 gene is deleted, the life span is shortened. 
So the classical evolutionary theory of aging must be modified.
Does SIR2 also promote survival in mammals?
Possibly, but we must bear in mind that the cell death response is a way to cull genetically damaged cells before they progress into tumors.
If single genes can determine the life span of mammals, it should be possible to develop drugs that bind to these genes' proteins and alter their activities.
Thus, drugs that slow the aging process could be around the corner. 
In mammals, we have not yet discovered the molecular basis of the longevity.
What accounts for this wide divergence?
But the rest of Western Europe and Japan have not.
Western Europe and the US are both post-industrial democracies.
The Fragility of a Flat World
Seattle and Vancouver are close geographically, but Vancouver trades more with distant Toronto than with nearby Seattle.
Tremendous declines in computing, communication, and transport costs have democratized technology.
Today, less than a quarter are located there.
But flattening is reversible.
It has happened before.
While the American and Chinese economies are highly interdependent today, so, too, were Germany and Britain before 1914.
The greater threat to a flat world is likely to come from the non-state and transnational forces that have been unleashed by the diffusion of technology.
I have called this the privatization of war.
Borders will become harder to cross for both people and goods.
But the events described above could reverse such policies.
In that case, the flat world could become a desert.
The French Cul de Sac
The last surplus was in 1974.
By contrast, the French government and the French central bank cannot create euros.
For the French, achieving a European political union is a way to increase Europe’s role in the world and France’s role within Europe.
The gap is bridged by a mixture of deficit spending and high taxation on employment.
(In fact, chronically high unemployment has meant that they have been doing so for years.)
What role should religion play in public affairs?
The results form a crucial database of experience.
But it pays off.
The fall of the Shah in Iran had ruinous consequences for that country.
Each country is looking to change and move forward.
North Africa’s people know what they don’t want – and won’t accept.
But they are struggling to identify what they do want, and how to build it.
The Fukushima Syndrome
BIRMINGHAM – The dramatic events that unfolded at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear-power plant after last year’s tsunami are commonly referred to as “the Fukushima disaster.”
To be sure, the environmental impact on those living close to Fukushima may take many years to remediate.
The first is safety; the second is radiation.
Would the many people who would ban nuclear power also prohibit air travel?
We all appreciate that an airplane is a sophisticated device, and that a bicycle is not.
Accordingly, designing and manufacturing an airplane is many times more demanding and thorough than designing and assembling a bicycle is.
The same can be said of the approximately 450 nuclear reactors around the world.
Remember, too, that Fukushima was built in the 1970’s, and that the technology on which it was based dated from a decade earlier.
The world is full of radioactivity – walls, concrete, even bananas contain traces – and our bodies have adapted to it.
But that requires formulating a roadmap that tells us where we stand and what we must do.
Fukushima is one of them.
ITER is often presented as the long-term solution to the problem of global warming, because nuclear fusion can provide an infinite and clean source of energy.
They often add that, since fusion burns hydrogen, which can be found in seawater, it is an infinite source of energy.
This must be done in a ultra-high vacuum in a large chamber.
Since the fusion reactions produce alpha particles, which pollute the plasma, one has to insert a “divertor” inside the flame at 100 million degrees in order to clean it.
An enlightened strategy must encourage China to “grow green,” as opposed to growing rapidly now and facing massive environmental costs later.
As is often the case, fiction best reflects the changing mood.
The Future of Europe
In 1900, Europe accounted for a quarter of the world’s population.
But if you have a responsibility for checking facts, you listen more carefully.
On what sources does the speaker base his facts?
Was Mr. Smith 42 or already 43?
My life was ruled by tk – which stands for “to kum,” or “to come,” in the jargon of reporters.
Now tk title at Widgets Corp., he…” Our job was to fill in the tk’s.
But what about other kinds of bias?
Does she have any kind of disclosures on her blog?
What company does the product reviewer work for?
But are they?
The precautionary principle is the better known of the two, and increasingly figures in environmental and health legislation.
It is normally understood as the Hippocratic Oath applied to the global ecology: above all, do no harm.
However, that transformation is moving at once in two diametrically opposed directions, which I have called “Humanity 2.0.”
At the very least, they would re-engineer our biology, if not replace it altogether with some intellectually superior and more durable substratum.
They still require the leadership of great powers.
The answer is likely to lie in what Europeans have dubbed “variable geometry.”
For example, on monetary affairs, the Bretton Woods conference created the International Monetary Fund in 1944, and it has since expanded to include 186 countries.
In the financial crisis of 2008, this framework evolved into the G-20, which boasts a more inclusive membership.
After all, with three countries, there are three bilateral relationships; with ten, there are 45; and with 100 players, there are nearly 5,000.
The Future of the Japan-US Alliance
China’s internal evolution also remains uncertain.
It has lifted 400 million people out of poverty since 1990, but another 400 million live on less that $2 per day.
(In 1918, avian flu killed more people than died in World War I).
The Future(s) of Civil Aeronautics
HAMPTON, VIRGINIA -- Civil aeronautics is in the midst of becoming a “mature” industry, with all the drawbacks that this entails.
Automatic aircraft operation is already becoming commonplace – especially in the military – but further increases will require a similarly automatic airspace.
Such designs could be enabled by using circulation control for high lift and employed at cruising altitude for ride quality.
Instead, the industry must re-invent itself.
The G-20’s Empty Gestures
The United States wins first prize with a trade deficit of more than $650 billion in the most recent 12 months.
Only China and the US, and perhaps Germany and Japan, will be at center stage.
It is an implication of the national income-accounting definitions.
And the reverse is true for the Chinese, German, and Japanese current-account surpluses.
The G-20’s Empty Promises
These are the right things to promise.
But what will such promises mean?
Reversing the upsurge in fiscal deficits is also critical to the global economy’s health.
Not only was it located in one, but, in many ways, it was also dominated by them.
Emerging economies once again spoke nearly in unison.
Other parts of the development agenda – for example, health and education – will not be the G-20’s focus.
The G-20’s Next Test
Not everyone is in agreement about this.
How painful will the adjustment be?
This may not happen.
What if the divergence between the North and South within the G-20 widens further?
Four consequences are likely.
First, there will be a significant drag on world growth.
We are now at the halfway point.
The G-8 is now reaping the consequences of its inaction.
Aid cannot be a guessing game.
Fortunately, what needs to be done is not complicated.
The Gambler of North Korea
SEOUL – After a painstaking investigation, South Korea is pointing the finger of blame at North Korea for the sinking of its warship, the Cheonan, on March 26.
This time, the authorities froze South Korean real estate in the Geumgang Mountain tourist zone and, most seriously of all, attacked the Cheonan.
The second change concerns Kim’s successor.
In El Salvador, the gangs became an issue at the end of the 1980’s; in Guatemala and Honduras, the gangs appeared in the first half of the 1990’s.
Nicaragua and Mexico, which receive many deportees from the United States, have never had the number of gang members seen in El Salvador and Guatemala.
Part of the problem lies in how Central American governments confront the phenomena.
Gazprom’s dominance is reinforced by activities coordinated with the Kremlin to assert its influence in markets like Spain and Italy.
As long as Gazprom remains opaque, Europe cannot know whether its key supplier is spending enough to develop future reserves.
Brussels must demand transparency, symmetry, and the rule of law from Moscow, with the goal being a revolutionary integration of European and Russian energy markets.
The very downstream access Gazprom wants in Europe is the EU’s trump card.
Many of the results of human studies are highly preliminary and do not actually identify a gene.
Instead, a wide variety of genes influence each characteristic. 
Fruit fly genes are surprisingly similar to ours--as they are to those of most other creatures.
Even many aspects of their behavior resemble our own.
Fruit flies are not geniuses, but "cramming" works no better for them than it does for us.
Genes influence each other and are in turn influenced by the surrounding world.
The result is always a unique individual. 
Beyond genetics, all creatures experience a non-identical sequence of life events.
Genetically identical bacteria represent an extreme case.
Only they could quickly come to the assistance of the giant housing finance institutions US Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and then deal with AIG.
Now there will be plenty of reasons why the Chinese pulled back.
NEW DELHI – Will “mission creep” in the West’s intervention in Libya end up creating, inadvertently, a jihadist citadel at Europe’s southern doorstep?
The Geopolitics of Football
For football lovers, FIFA (the governing body of international football) should have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize long ago.
In 1969, Honduras and Salvador clashed after a qualification game for the World Cup.
Antagonism was confined to the stadium, and ended when the match did.
Sport, indeed, seems to be the best barometer of relations between the divided Korean people.
Perhaps one day it will take place.
But in football, the elimination of an adversary is always temporary.
A return match is always possible.
But I want France to avenge its defeat at the last World Cup in Seville, not its defeat at Verdun.
The Ghost in the Recovery Machine
(The largest six-month decrease was, you guessed it, during the Great Depression, when the index fell 47% from November 1931 to May 1932.)
During any negotiations with Cuba’s leaders, European politicians and diplomats should remind their Cuban partners of their obligations.
Obasanjo and the ruling Peoples Democratic Party were re-elected in May 2003 in controversial circumstances.
Simultaneously, the eastern part of the country descended into anarchy.
The north dominated the armed forces following the Biafra civil war in the late 1960’s.
Obasanjo’s election marked the return of civilian rule.
For now, the north appears divided.
Chavez is no longer a lonely populist.
This other left, however, is not radical.
Easy applause can no longer be had by attacking big business or the IMF.
The Latin American left does not share George W. Bush’s view of the world.
President Lula and others on the left mostly prefer to hold their tongues.
And it is here where its biggest challenges will emerge.
So the ghost of Augusto Pinochet lingers.
But the three countries that prospective members can be compared to may be  outside  the eurozone.
Indeed, in September 2003, the three "reference" countries would have been Lithuania, Poland, and the Czech Republic, were they already members of the EU (they join in May).
But such inflation represents a natural adjustment of relative prices resulting from faster growth.
Again, these could easily prove to be three new EU members outside the eurozone.
On the exchange rate, a narrow fluctuation band should be avoided.
I suggest creating an "ERM light."
However, intervention would not be required at these margins.
In Charles Dicken's great novel "A Christmas Carol," the soulless businessman Ebeneezer Scrooge is tormented by a visit from the Spirit of Christmas Past.
Ebeneezer Scrooge's nocturnal visitors were able to convince him of the errors of his ways.
They agreed that protectionism was obviously a vice, but thought that it was a necessary one that could not be addressed without monetary stability.
Germany’s president had just appointed Adolf Hitler’s radical and aggressive government.
The Japanese government had just sent troops into Manchuria.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, a close associate of Erdogan in the AKP, pressed Turkey’s application to join the European Union.
The Global Economics of Desire
How concerned should advanced countries be about the outsourcing of manufacturing to China or software development to India?
Virtually all the toys and shoes sold in the US are made in the Far East.
China alone accounts for 86% of the US bicycle market.
A critical factor is large scale, non-destructive creation.
Airplanes, for instance, didn't reduce demand for automobiles: people fly when they would not otherwise have driven.
Money talks, and it is corrupting politics and markets all over the world.
A massive insider-trading ring is currently on trial in New York, and has implicated some leading financial-industry figures.
The current governor of Florida, Rick Scott, was CEO of a major health-care company known as Columbia/HCA.
The FBI’s investigation forced Scott out of his job.
But, a decade after the company’s guilty pleas, Scott is back, this time as a “free-market” Republican politician.
First, big companies are now multinational, while governments remain national.
The Global Economy’s Dialogue of the Deaf
To meet this goal, some changes would be in order.
Important decisions should be vetted by the IMFC and others delegated to IMF management.
Monetary policy alone cannot resolve the consequences of inaction by regulators and supervisors amid the credit excesses of the last few years.
NEW YORK – The global economy this year will exhibit some similarities with the conditions that prevailed in 2012.
Markets may become spooked by another fiscal cliffhanger.
Indeed, the Arab Spring is turning into an Arab Winter.
Markets have been understandably buoyant in the first quarter of 2013.
The sequence is now well established.
Markets also welcome the fact that the Fed’s hyperactive experimentation is forcing other central banks around the world to pursue more expansionary policies.
An investor in Paris, Rio de Janeiro, or Tokyo will be able to invest in owner-occupied homes in New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.
We may need backwardation in some of these markets if they are to fulfill their function.
So these were not just political revolutions.
I’d tell myself, ‘They are too humungous, it’s like throwing something in the sea,’” he writes.
Satellite, tweets, and Facebook statuses beamed that same message to the world.
In Egypt, the power of the military is more concentrated now than it was under former President Hosni Mubarak.
But holders of US debt worldwide have every reason to be concerned.
As a result, the recession has been deeper and longer than it would otherwise have been.
Significantly, foreclosures rose 7% month on month in June, and a whopping 32% compared to June 2008.
The World After November
So is the world itself.
The Middle East, in particular, is experiencing a moment of intense transformation.
While reconstruction – both literal and figurative – is commencing in some parts of the region, countries like Syria are aflame.
Annual growth in shale-gas production has increased from 17% between 2000 and 2006 to 48% between 2006 and 2010.
But it is not just the new US leader who will inherit a changed world.
It is crucial to engage with the southern Mediterranean region as a critical meeting point – a place of political, economic, and energy cooperation.
Mental Health for All
Every member of the community must be empowered to protect and improve their own mental health, and that of those around them.
The Global Innovation Revolution
Many countries are also changing their immigration laws to make it easier to attract highly skilled workers, especially scientists and engineers, who are increasingly mobile.
It is also a moving target.
But expectations created by pre-crisis growth patterns adjust slowly.
The Globalization of Ethics
As early as the third century B.C., Buddhism spread peacefully from India to Sri Lanka and to large parts of Southeast Asia.
This is the essence of morality.”
The overthrow of King Louis Phillipe in France in 1848 was carried by the recently introduced telegraph to Germany, igniting revolution.
On other occasions, protests such as May Day marches were transformed into widespread social mobilization, as happened in France on May 1, 1968.
In ninety days, these organizers turned out more than 5 million protestors worldwide.
The Globalization of Old Age
That's true in many ways. But rich countries are also getting older.
People aged 60 or more are projected to increase from 629 million now to nearly 2 billion by 2050.
Furthermore, the elderly population itself is aging.
This is not to deny that some of the 1% have contributed a great deal.
They are an alarm.
Their hope is evolutionary, not revolutionary.
The Globalization of Science
SAN FRANCISCO – Science provides an invaluable source of guidance to individuals and governments.
This is not to say that scientists should dominate the government decision-making process.
The first IAC report was entitled  Inventing a Better Future: A Strategy for Building Worldwide Capacities in Science and Technology .
The God of Suffering?
Christians think we do.
The seventeenth-century French philosopher René Descartes solved it by the drastic expedient of denying that animals can suffer.
People who live with a dog or a cat are not likely to find that persuasive.
He used the example of a child born with one limb missing.
It is as if an ant should try to understand our decisions, so puny is our intelligence in comparison with the infinite wisdom of God.
But then he would just turn around and give it back so everyone else can see it, so there is no point.
Gabriel is not entirely convinced.
He could buy all the teams in the league, right?” Yes, I say.
But if Bill Gates were to own the entire NBA, how would he decide which team to root for?
Gabriel concedes the point, but I can tell that again he is not convinced.
Gates is not the only one who can easily buy teams and paintings.
That is $9,000 per minute, or $540,000 per hour.
But this seems too complicated to explain to Gabriel just yet.
Gabriel says he is going to think about it.
Now he is being condemned by some critics of Israel’s human rights record for retracting his finding of intentionality.
What is not in dispute about the “Goldstone Report” is the fact-finding on which its conclusions are based.
Hammurabi, Raamses II, Solon, Confucius, and Pericles were among the first great figures to embark on this effort.
Yet the year 2004 may leave to history some of the greatest progress in this area that humanity has seen.
Morocco and Algeria are working to strengthen women's rights.
Israel will not be able to ignore completely the rulings of either court.

While African political leaders have ultimate responsibility for protecting their citizens, faith communities share deeply in this commitment.
Supporters of every religion in 106 countries have answered the call.
In many instances, they can reach deep into inaccessible rural areas to deliver services.
This initiative has received the backing of the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa’ad Abubakar III, the country’s leading Muslim, and the Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, John Oneiyekan.
CANBERRA/SEOUL – Almost four years after the start of the global financial crisis, the world economy remains fragile and unemployment is unacceptably high.
We see two components to such a strategy.
Among other major economies: the United Kingdom, 14.4%; France, 8.2%; India, 8.0%; Japan, 7.4%; Italy, 5.4%; Germany, 4.7%; China 4.2%; and Canada, 2.4%.
This is standard practice for US state and local governments.
President Fernando de la Rúa was brought down by riots that left 29 dead.
Inflation was the grease that had kept the wheels of Argentine politics going.
The magic wand illusion was not invented in Argentina.
In Europe, the combined carrot of northern transfers and the stick of northern reproach did the trick.
No matter what, don't touch the currency board, the linchpin of your credibility.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, the government did not go on a spending binge.
Yes, the US economy has been on a weak recovery trajectory over the past three years.
Think again.
Latin America provided the second-largest source of America’s export resurgence, accounting for another 28% of the total gains in US foreign sales over the past three years.
Greenspan’s warning in 1998 came at a time when US exports accounted for only about 10.5% of GDP.
The Great American Tea Party
This tax-free jamboree of patriotism was ostensibly non-partisan (otherwise it could not have been tax-free).
For it was here, on this very same spot and date, that he gave his “I have a dream” speech in 1963.
The majority have no college degree.
This is not impossible.
John F. Kennedy was good at selling the American dream.
Lyndon B. Johnson had the common touch of rural Texas.
In his History of European Morals, published in 1869, the Irish historian and philosopher W.E.H. Lecky wrote:
The Project has proven controversial.
Chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas have long-term relationships, not only between mothers and children, but also between unrelated apes.
But in evolutionary terms this is nonsense.
Chimpanzees and bonobos are our closest relatives, and we humans, not gorillas or orangutans, are their closest relatives.
The Dutch government subsequently banned biomedical research on chimpanzees.
Thus, there is no European medical research currently being conducted on great apes, and one barrier to granting them some basic rights has collapsed.
Faculty are on the move, too.
Half of the world’s top physicists no longer work in their native countries.
And major institutions such as New York University and the University of Nottingham are creating branch campuses in the Middle East and Asia.
The Great Contraction of 2008-2009
The optimists say not to worry.
Many banks’ weaknesses are simply being masked by government guarantees.
But how much higher?
We now have a daily index for the US, the Gallup Economic Confidence Index, so we can pinpoint changes in confidence over time.
The story played out in the news media every day.
Indeed, this is arguably a more captivating story than was the most intense moment of the financial crisis, in 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed.
This is a much bigger downswing than was recorded in the overall consumer-confidence indices.
The first, and most famous, pathology was the stock market crash of October 1929 in the United States.
The 1929 crash had no obvious cause, but two very plausible solutions.
But repairing the damage was tough.
The 1930’s are relevant here as well, given another series of defaults among European states, not least Germany.
After all, British public debt exceeded 250% of GDP in the aftermath of World War II, and Britain did not default.
But attitudes changed as soon as the crisis erupted in 2007-2008.
They were right to do so.
History can be an essential compass when past experience provides unambiguous headings.
The Great Escapism
In the 1950’s, Jack Kerouac took his buddy careening across the country in On the Road.
From Easy Rider in the 1960’s to the Harold and Kumar movies today, the “buddy film” – typically involving travel-based adventure – has become an established genre.
Male protagonists in French films don’t take off together in convertibles for the Pyrenees; they stay home and urbanely have affairs.
Nor does Japanese pop culture manufacture escape fantasies aimed at Japanese men.
At its best, this genre is part of America’s gift to the rest of the world.
To the rest of the world, those same qualities are part of his charm only so long as he stays safely up on the screen.
The Great European Debt Breakup
But this is precisely what our proposal to split eurozone sovereign debt into senior and junior tranches aims to achieve.
The Great Firewall of China
If that sounds familiar, its is because the Chinese Communist Party never forgets its history – and is determined to prevent history from repeating itself.
Thus, China’s rulers acted in character last December, when they cracked down on news organizations that were getting a bit too assertive.
The editor and deputy editors of Beijing News, a relatively new tabloid with a national reputation for exposing corruption and official abuse, were fired.
An editorial assistant at the New York Times, Zhao Jing, writing under the pen name Michael Anti, broke the news on his widely read Chinese-language blog.
He exposed details of behind-the-scenes politics and called for a public boycott of the newspaper, evoking strong public sympathy for the journalists, expressed online in chatrooms and blogs.
Zhao’s blog wasn’t under the direct control of the Party’s Propaganda Department.
It was published through a Chinese-language blog-hosting service run by Microsoft’s MSN Spaces.
The system is bolstered by human surveillance and censorship carried out not only by government employees, but also by private service providers.
These services, with names like Bokee.com, Blogbus.com and Blogcn.com, all comply with Chinese government censorship requirements.
These businesses would not be allowed to exist otherwise.
New pop cultural celebrities are emerging online, and people are creating their own radio and even TV shows.
Naturally, the Chinese companies that provide most of the tools used to create and host this content have censorship built into their software, management structure, and business models.
But most Chinese bloggers accept this as part of the reality of life in China.
Which brings us back to China’s greatest modern writer, Lu Xun.
They have made it clear that when it comes to free expression, their priorities lie on the side of surrender.
One day, perhaps, censorship will no longer make good business sense anywhere.
It is against this backdrop that the latest contest between India and China must be assessed.
The road, after all, is a vital link in China’s quest for direct access to the Arabian Sea.
Indeed, the pincer of Afghanistan and Gilgit/Baltistan poses the gravest challenge to India’s statecraft since Independence.
Mexico, the G-20’s host, also pledged $10 billion.
Various countries, however, are also strengthening their own positions with little regard for the impact of their actions on the international financial system.
Indeed, in an editorial published on June 15, China Daily described Greece as a “gateway” for China into Europe.
Consider Iceland, which suffered bitterly following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
The Great Hydrogen Hope
The hydrogen projects are being developed in North America, Europe, Japan, Korea, Australia, South America, and, embryonically, in China and India.
Most of the hydrogen-driven vehicles are powered by fuel cells, but both BMW and Mazda have converted gasoline engines to hydrogen fuel (spiffy V-12s for BMW, rotary engines for Mazda).
The Great Illusion
Much architecture has been turned into rubble.
Indeed, we have seen more religious wars than at any time since the end of the Thirty Years War in 1648.
Now there are none.
The Great Job Machine
In many European countries, you should instead look at the quality of the stereo in your taxi.
Yet beneath the surface, things are beginning to move in Europe.
The American service industry job machine may be on its way across the Atlantic.
The Great Man Syndrome
We will never know.
India appeared mired in stagnation.
Of course, the years since 1987 have not been without big macroeconomic shocks.
Before 1985, according to this theory, central bankers switched their objectives from year to year.
Our luck has not been good since 1985.
Another man says, “I am a Filipino.
I am willing to sell my kidney for my wife.
21 years old and healthy.”
One is people in distress.
In an era of transplants on demand, there is no way around this dilemma.
These are the market’s forecasts – and it is not a very liquid market.
And why does the housing market in so many other countries now reflect similar conditions?
Shacks were selling for a million dollars.
But the credit cycle was not the ultimate cause of the 1870’s depression or the crisis we are seeing today.
Such ideas create artificial demand – but only for a while.
After all, we no longer smoke cigarettes to prevent infections.
But their belief can suddenly be disrupted if plainly visible events contradict it.
The Greek Conundrum
The principle, however, is patently flawed.
Together they constitute too large a portion of the euro zone to be helped out by makeshift arrangements.
Moreover, a well-organized eurobond market would be desirable.
The Greek Crisis and Beyond
That structure is no more.
“Bolivia is rich,” a Tacana Indian woman told me last week inside Madidi National Park.
As the December 18 presidential elections approach, the front-runners could not look much different from one another.
The Green Inquisition
Gore’s scientific advisor, Jim Hansen from NASA, has even topped his protégé.
Hansen suggests that there will eventually be sea-level rises of 24 meters (80 feet), with a six-meter rise happening just this century.
For two years, sea levels have declined.
(All of the data are available at sealevel.colorado.edu.)
This is not terrifying or even particularly scary – 30 centimeters is how much the sea rose over the last 150 years.
But it is perhaps also a symptom of a broader problem.
The Green Paradox
They must succeed in inducing the oil sheikhs and other producers of fossil fuels to throttle their pumps.
If they do not extract it today, they will have to do it in the future if they want to make a profit.
This is not plausible.
Indeed, the sheikhs will know that, in all likelihood, concerns about global warming will increase over time.
The good news from Heiligendamm is that the UN will now have to organize a common solution.
The Green Pseudo-Revolution
Many green pundits have, however, started saying that the financial crisis only makes the need for action on climate change greater.
Indeed, the environmental movement – like most modern social movements – began in the US.
The Greening of China
For example, visitors and residents alike have long thought of Hong Kong as a beautiful city clinging to the South China coast.
Indeed, the joint air-monitoring network provides a foundation for the region to develop a sophisticated regional air management program.
Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute has proposed what he calls the “negawatt,” or energy that is never used.
The Greening of New York
Already, New York City produces more CO2 emissions than all of Norway.
In the US, the urban population has grown from 97 million in 1950 to 222 million in 2000.
Vehicles cause nearly a fifth of New York City’s CO2 emissions.
This implies an annual cost of around $200 billion.
PlaNYC would impose the congestion charge on the 4.6% of New York City residents who drive to work, while its benefits would accrue to everyone.
In fact, service and delivery providers in Manhattan, among others, would benefit from shorter travel times and fewer delays.
However, despite its many advantages, congestion charges face some skepticism.
In London, bus-travel rose by 46%.
New York City has always been a global leader in finance, the arts, and many other fields.
The Greening of Work
Clearly, change is in the air.
But they used to be small.
After all, global optimization would require a global policymaking authority, which we do not have.
Decentralized policy and growing externalities will result in partial de-globalization, especially in macroeconomic configurations, finance, and capital accounts.
The colonial borders are being called into question, and what will become of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan is difficult to forecast.
What will become of the Korean Peninsula?
Can India and China stem the deterioration in bilateral relations?
Too Big To Handle
Our biggest banks must become simpler.
Hoenig and Richard Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, have been leading the charge on this issue within the Federal Reserve System.
Ross got it right again this week, when he said:
He continued,
Hoenig and Fisher have the right vision.
Ross and many others in the private sector fully understand what needs to be done.
Two Dollar Fallacies
The problem is that foreign holdings of dollar securities are no longer primarily “foreign exchange reserves” in the traditional sense.
If they perceive that the dollar and dollar bonds have become riskier, they will want to change the distribution of assets in their portfolios.
Democracy in Arabia?
Indeed, just 16% reported that pop stars influenced their outlook.
As a result, “mechanistic solidarity” grows stronger at the expense of “organic solidarity.”
In more homogenous societies, such as Libya, social solidarity tends to follow tribal and partisan lines.
A dramatic manifestation of the mechanistic pattern of solidarity is now emerging in Syria, as well.
Mechanistic solidarity has emerged as a more effective means to mobilize people and resources.
At the heart of the crisis is a strong element of indifference.
The Gulag of the Russian Mind
By December 1991, the Soviet empire was no more.
Georgia, which is both European and Asiatic, teeters on the edge of instability.
The dream of empire is, indeed, the gulag that imprisons the Russian mind.
Joseph Stalin’s industrialization killed millions – and became obsolete in only 30 years.
The Guns and Gold of August
It is not the solution to all problems.
In contrast, China ended August with its soft power enhanced by its successful Olympic Games.
But China’s government did not achieve all its Olympic objectives.
Unlike an Olympic competition, their recent performance will not be given a final score until well after their power games have been played.
The Hague Tribunal: Belgrade\u0027s View
He knows that, although the Serbian lobby is weak in the US, it is all�powerful in Serbia.
But ever since the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia was established in 1993 by the UN Security Council, I have been disappointed.
Not a shred of new or recent evidence was presented.
The Haitian Miracle?
Now, Haiti can turn its geography into a competitive advantage, but only if the United States helps.
However, proximity has also meant US meddling.
Even after recognition by President Abraham Lincoln in 1862, relations remained sour.
And, with its beautiful beaches and remarkable arts and music, Haiti could once again become a major tourist destination.
Hamas’s crushing defeat of Fatah in this week’s elections brings the Palestinian people to a crossroads.
Overall, that’s 60% of the seats in Parliament, won in nearly every district in the West Bank and Gaza.
It is unlikely that Hamas will form a government composed of hardliners.
This, indeed, is the language of Hamas’s 1988 covenant.
On the other hand, the platform repeats Hamas’s refusal to relinquish even an inch of historic Palestine.
Palestinians have entered uncharted waters.
The Hamas Moment
The region, probably the Arab-Israeli conflict, and certainly the Palestinian movement, will never be the same.
In some ways, Hamas’s coup makes things clearer.
PARIS – The central paradox of French politics was confirmed once again on March 27.
And, with that change, the fate of the Front may be changing, too.
Thus, in a direct run-off between a Front candidate and a Socialist or UMP candidate, the Socialists and the UMP usually vote for each other.
But, like it or not, the Front is a legal party.
His daughter, however, has clearly softened the tone.
Anti-capitalist revolution was tried in half of Europe in the last century, with dire results.
Expulsion of immigrants has not.
But to assess their relevance, three questions must be asked: was such harmonization necessary?
Dividends are supposed to be a share of profits; here it was simply a share of government largesse.
That has not happened.
The second important lesson involves understanding why markets often do not work the way they are meant to work.
There are many reasons for market failures.
Excessive focus on inflation meant that some central banks ignored what was happening to their financial markets.
The Healing of Taiwan
He did not act alone.
Taiwan’s former first family turned out to be a den of common thieves.
In my own country, Pakistan, Karachi is growing at a rate of 1,000 people per day.
In Pakistan, for example, there are 60 million mobile phone subscribers in a population of 160 million.
After all, it was once widely asserted that an African-American without a political machine could not become president.
Moreover, the sharpest decline occurred more than four decades ago, in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s.
The Healthier Poor
For every 1,000 children born in rich countries, seven die before their fifth birthday; for every 1,000 births in the poorest countries, 155 children die before their fifth birthday.
I shot a line back, requesting the missing attachment.
Of course, roughly 1,000 of the world’s 9,000 hedge funds went out of business last year.
The Heirs of Inequality
Similarly, average annual growth in the United States has slowed from around 4% between 1870 and 1973 to roughly 2% since then.
Curiously, hard times may actually trigger among the economy’s losers a psychological mechanism known as “last-place aversion.”
The Hero of His Time
Boris Yeltsin was utterly unique.
But he was also profoundly characteristic of Russian leaders.
And yet in the final years of his rule, his reputation plunged.
Yeltsin’s tragedy, and Russia’s, was that, when the country needed a leader with vision and determination, it found an agile political operator instead.
PRINCETON – When people say that “Money is the root of all evil,” they usually don’t mean that money itself is the root of evil.
Like Saint Paul, from whom the quote comes, they have in mind the love of money.
Karl Marx thought so.
With others, they left piles of Monopoly money nearby.
For example, where the control group would offer to spend an average of 42 minutes helping someone with a task, those primed to think about money offered only 25 minutes.
But now that we are aware of the isolating power that even the thought of money can have, we can no longer think of money’s role as being entirely neutral.
Harvard economist Roland Fryer’s proposal to pay poor students for doing well at school is another area where using money is open to question.
Often, they will – for example, if the parents lack the skills to build a good playground.
The Hidden Future of the US Economy
CAMBRIDGE – Just how bad is the outlook for the United States’ economy?
But just what does that mean?
But that information remains hidden.
The government programs failed to provide the “pump-priming” role that was intended.
They provided an early spark, but it looks like the spark did not catch.
So does the ability of households to borrow and lend in order not to be forced to match income and expenditure every day, week, month, or year.
We do not live in such a world.
It is like describing how one could bake a delicious wedding cake using only honey, bicarbonate of soda, and raw eggplant.
And it is why, even in the face of a severe financial crisis, we remain frozen today.
Yet not nearly enough is being done to treat or prevent it.
Depression is an individual tragedy that is multiplied more than 100 million times worldwide.
So, while we can and should do much better at treating it, perhaps the more significant question is whether we can learn to prevent it.
The puzzle is that, from 550 to 1500 AD, Chinese civilization once led the world in technology and probably in economic well-being.
Turn the clock back six centuries, to the early 1400s.
Chinese fine arts, exemplified by its porcelains that would be craved by the world for centuries to come, were remarkable by the standards of any age.
Archeologists today find Chinese porcelain shards in Kenya and Tanzania.
Trade and exchange continued only at a trickle.
China unilaterally abandoned its role in the world.
Smith described the European discoveries of the sea passage to Asia (around the southern tip of Africa) and the Americas as the two greatest events in world history.
Change, however, did not come smooth.
It wasn't until 1978, under Deng Xiaoping, that China opened up to the world.
The History at the End of History
They can also provide funding, advice, technical assistance, and yes, occasionally military force to help the process along.
The History Man
Ho Chi Minh was not Saddam Hussein.
Women got the vote.
Civil liberties were boosted.
South Koreans certainly have much to thank the Americans for.
The same was true in the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand, and, indeed, in the Middle East, where democracy is yet to take root.
The Hollow Heart of the West
BERLIN – It is tempting to compare NATO and the European Union to the French and Italian football teams in this year’s Euro 2008 competition.
The question is far from abstract.
In the artistic imagination of Europeans, America has become associated more with servitude than with freedom.
In the Berlin Opera’s latest version of Beethoven’s Fidelio, the prisoners seemed to be coming out of Guantánamo.
By losing its geographic focus, NATO is now confronted with a major identity challenge.
Is it to become a “league of democracy”?
What is Europe’s project today?
Where does the EU end?
How do you recreate a European “narrative” that reconciles the Union with its citizens?
The Honor of Exile
The Romanian sculptor Brancusi once said that when the artist is no longer a child, he is dead.
That is when the wonder of words, the magic of literature started for me.
Illness and therapy began at the same time.
Soon, too soon, I wanted myself to be part of that family of word wizards, those secret relatives of mine.
Yet the need for something drastically different and higher than the framed daily routine of an engineer and a citizen of the socialist paradise did not diminish.
Inevitably, in the bright public square, Augustus the Fool, the poet, faces the Clown of Power.
All human tragicomedy may be seen, occasionally, in this encounter, in the history of Circus as History.
Nonetheless, the totalitarian experience remains incomparable in its pathology, in its masks and mendacity.
An artist who has lived under tyranny (and even one who hasn't) cannot ignore the barrier that separates the two roles.
Language is always home and homeland for a writer.
Eventually, I took the language, the home, with me, as a snail does.
More and more, exile is an emblem of our time.
It is impossible to predict what place, if any, literature will have in the future.
The Hothouse of US-China Relations
But that is precisely what Weber did.
Most economists understood the downside risks of European monetary union.
At the same time, all three received academic training at Harvard.
Having good international credentials is not always an advantage.
The Human Face of Climate Change
Where is the justice in this?
Harvests may halve and rivers on which irrigation and hydropower depend may become a mere trickle.
The mudding-through countries lag behind.
As Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne put it:
“The emergency Budget in June was the moment when fiscal credibility was restored.
But that is why Keynes and Harry Dexter White established the IMF in the first place.
Food riots have erupted in West Africa and South Asia.
Shortened lives mean less economic output and income.
Hunger leaves people more susceptible to disease, requiring more health-care spending.
Specific interventions to help these regions’ people would have massive benefits.
The annual cost?
As little as $0.10 per person.
And there are benefits to treating even younger children.
One of the most important opportunities to provide educational messages about nutrition comes during pregnancy.
Hybrid Humans
SINGAPORE – The election of a new pope always sparks debate about the tension between tradition and modernity in the Catholic Church.
Perhaps more interesting is the ongoing modernization of the language in which those debates are conducted: Latin.
But do widely accepted labels like “Information Age” and “knowledge-based society” adequately describe the global movement that is underway?
Man-made cells can now be inserted into humans.
Indeed, the Hybrid Age is shaping up to be an era of “geo-technology.”
Some believe that, with the rise of China, Pax Sinica is next.
But these eras have been characterized by conquest and exploitation, not peace.
"Become who you are," wrote the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.
If Nietzsche were alive today, he might be pitching antidepressants for Pfizer.
To be fulfilled, you must be in touch with yourself.
Not necessarily.
One worry is about what the philosopher Margaret Olivia Little calls "cultural complicity."
The same goes for light skin, large breasts, Gentile noses, or a sparkling personality.
Market pressures compound this worry.
Indeed, it has already failed in Ireland, Latvia, and Greece.
And the confidence that this engenders leads to still further growth.
The Ides of August
The Idle Fireman
But the situation is different now.
So what’s wrong with the fireman?
But a tendency toward a bubble need not become a reality.
A Metaphor for Obama
So, what makes a successful metaphor work?
Nor does “Hope” or “Yes we can!”
By contrast, in the 1930’s, President Franklin Roosevelt used a metaphor that remains very much alive today.
It is not imposed.
Acemoglu and Robinson argue that in the broad sweep of history, political orders that include everyone in the economic process are more likely to succeed in the long term.
We have not reached the pinnacle of economic inclusion.
Such reforms, though feasible, I confess are unlikely.
The IMF’s first two managing directors, the Belgian Camille Gutt and the Swede Ivar Rooth, were both weak figures.
Horst Köhler, appointed in 2000, got the millennium started on a bad note.
He had been an influential state secretary in Germany’s finance ministry, before becoming the head of the associations of savings banks.
Asia remained leery of the Fund a full ten years after the currency crises of the late 1990’s.
We have just lived through one of these episodes.
The two are clearly interlinked.
The Special Drawing Right, the IMF-issued reserve currency based on a basket comprising the dollar, euro, yen, and pound sterling, may play a useful role here.
But continued political support for the IMF needs to be based on fairness in the institution itself.
It has yet to find one.
Indeed, growth in the 1990's was little more than half the rate recorded in the pre-reform decades of the 1960's and 1970's.
In Europe, the record of "conservative" economic prescriptions is little better.
While it has trimmed its welfare state, it has not abandoned it.
The IMF Does Europe
Welcome to the new era.
What a difference a crisis makes.
But gentleness is relative.
Simply put, no one wants to be the next major IMF supplicant.
Nor does the IMF’s arrival mean that bond holders are off the hook.
As Qian, Reinhart, and I document, there have been numerous instances in which countries enter IMF programs but end up defaulting anyway.
This is the last thing that it wants to do.
The question for the IMF in Europe is not whether it has a plan viable for getting in.
The IMF Fails Again
I was there.
Crises will not be things of the past.
It is one thing to rearrange the chairs around the table, and quite another to change the table itself or those who have a seat at it.
How many more meetings of the IMF will pass, how many more crises will occur, before this harsh truth sinks in?
Now, half-a-year later, the balance of responsibility needs to be reconsidered.
Throughout much of the world, the IMF is caricatured as a demon of austerity.
This image of austerity appeals to the emotional need for stories with villains.
After all, good villains sell books--including books about globalization that demonize the IMF.
The IMF is working to fill that gap now.
More often than not, the country has over-extended itself financially through some combination of imprudence and bad luck.
Just after I finished school, my older brother Hal ran into some financial difficulties.
Hal went to the bank for a loan, but with his business struggling, he didn't qualify.
With all his credit cards at their limit, and all his cash gone, Hal finally came to me for a loan.
Even with my help, things weren't easy.
Think about it.
Financial markets in fact owe French Socialists a great debt.
Then it was the turn of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Moreover, a change in China’s exchange rate would do little to alter the multilateral trade deficit in the US.
Americans might simply switch from buying Chinese textiles to imports from Bangladesh.
The IMF’s Half Step
When the eurozone panic ensued in July 2011, inflows came to a halt and fled to the “safety” of the United States, Switzerland, and beyond.
In many cases, the controls were neither market-based nor temporary.
The IMF’s New Direction
Clouds of uncertainty linger, however, and there is much unfinished business.
These issues have broad implications for global stability and peace.
In the annals of economic crises then, where do we find ourselves?
Policymakers need to follow through on their commitment to the peer review process.
All the parties begin to suspect political manipulation.
Today surveillance means, in effect, merely giving advice.
In the great panics of 1895-6 and 1907, J.P. Morgan calmed the US economy.
That push had been advocated by Western financial markets – and the Western finance ministries that serve them so loyally.
Iceland showed that responding to the crisis by imposing capital controls could help small countries manage its impact.
What is new is that the IMF has joined the chorus.
Strauss-Kahn is proving himself a sagacious leader of the IMF.
CAMBRIDGE – It’s official.
As long as it was developing countries that were whipsawed by global finance, it was fashionable to blame the victim.
Along the efficiency frontier of financial regulation, one needs to consider the tradeoff between financial innovation and financial stability.
The more of one we want, the less of the other we can have.
The Immigration Game
The US also has more realistic migration restrictions than most European countries.
Similarly, the Paper proposes that the self-employed should be admitted after an evaluation of their business plans.
In Milan this year, more foreigners than Italians registered as self-employed.
The Arab Spring’s Crowd Psychology
After Prime Minister Rafic Hariri was assassinated in February 2005, crowds led by various political parties filled Martyrs’ Square in downtown Beirut.
Social media are both part of the problem and part of the solution.
Gender norms are not static.
Societies, cultures, and potential markets change.
Gender norms are not static.
Societies, cultures, and potential markets change.
This will not end well.
But the deleveraging process will be gradual and orderly.
Two intriguing observations emerge from these two scenarios.
The middle class might turn against the party.
India represents only about 1-2% of the global pharmaceutical market.
But even healthy reproduction has a dark side.
By promoting a shift in public perceptions, such programs can catalyze fundamental behavioral changes.
International action is also crucial.
Syria’s G-Zero Fate
In other words, it all went exactly as expected.
Even Canada will sit this one out.
With so much internal liquidity, these businesses are not sensitive to reductions in market interest rates.
Until then, it is powerless.
Why Bo Stole the Show
But that is a naive interpretation.
Bo certainly did not disappoint.
LONDON – We all know how the global economic crisis began.
So how do we escape from this hole?
This is where economics becomes political economy.
The India Option
The first EU Galileo satellite – intended as an alternative to America’s GPS system – was launched in late December with India as a full partner.
To be sure, India is as wary of China as some in Europe and America are.
Yet neither India nor the EU wants their friendship to be part of an anti-China axis.
The Indian Tortoise and the Chinese Hare
In the West, there is so much focus on China that India’s achievements are often acknowledged only as an afterthought.
Not that China is exactly egalitarian.
Perhaps only one in five persons are integrated into the global economy.
For every call center employee, there are many more people still eking out a subsistence living on the land.
Whereas China probably has about 450 million people in its globalized economy, India has at most 200-250 million.
So, is the idea that India’s economy could overtake China’s hopeless romanticism?
India also has a much better developed financial system than China, an advantage that will be increasingly important as the two countries develop.
Only then will we truly start seeing “India everywhere.”
The Indians Strike Back
Gutierrez is the first president to have the support of Ecuador's powerful Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE).
Historically marginalized and impoverished indigenous peoples make up between 25% and 40% of Ecuador's population.
CONAIE, founded in 1986, originally focused on cultural rights and land redistribution.
Today, it is the leading critic of Ecuador's "neo-liberal" policies related to globalization.
Latin America's native peoples have awakened.
The Indispensable UN
The story since then is well known.
There was also an explosion of credit-card debt.
But did it cure the underlying problem?
The rich are mostly doing well.
Yet high and protracted unemployment plagues many less-skilled workers.
Corruption and failure to embrace meaningful political reform have become acute shortcomings.
Regime Change in China?
Another explanation is fear of contemplating the unknown.
Likewise, Vladimir Putin’s Russia, a deeply flawed hybrid autocracy, is nonetheless a far better place to live than the Soviet Union was.
ATHENS – European integration implies successive transfers of national sovereignty to the Union.
There is no easy solution to these problems.
And, as the Irish referendum showed, they do not readily accept unifying initiatives that would make the EU an autonomous center of power.
This is why the Lisbon Treaty is so important.
This view is outdated.
Since 1978, China’s political system has overseen the transfer of a wide swath of economic power from the state to its people.
One of us recently observed a street protest in Wuhan, the largest city in central China.
Such protests against public agencies, employers, and developers are now commonplace (though not always authorized).
The Eurozone’s Delayed Reckoning
Why Is US Inflation So Low?
Or, as I often hear, “Why has the Federal Reserve’s printing of so much money not caused higher inflation?”
During the past five years, the consumer price index has increased at an annual rate of just 1.5%.
That was very clear during Germany’s hyperinflation in the 1920’s and Latin America’s in the 1980’s.
As a result, the Fed has bought a massive amount of bonds without causing the stock of money – and thus the rate of inflation – to rise.
An increase in bank loans allows households and businesses to increase their spending.
So, while M2 grew by more than 6%, nominal GDP grew by just 3.5% and the GDP price index rose by only 1.7%.
The Pope and the Party
It can be distilled into four tenets:
Mussolini established the first Corporatist economy, albeit substituting “Fascist” for “Catholic” throughout.
Indeed, Corporatism spread to country after country.
Pius XI thought that “the leadership and teaching guidance of the Church...in this field also” precluded abuse of authority.
Industry ministries oversee vertical swaths of firms.
State-controlled banks allocate capital.
Should other countries have one, too?
The free flow of information constrains official power and gives individuals the power to act for themselves.
It is the essence of a free market, and it should also be the essence of a free democracy.
He or she should not attempt to centralize information, but rather to make it flow more smoothly.
Openness and transparency do not mean simply making everything available online, but making information easy to get to, compare, and analyze.
This includes everything from actual data to how those data are represented, facilitating comparisons of data across organizations and across time.
A big factor that contributes to the existence of viruses, spam, and the like is their lucrativeness.
First, sending an e-mail will need to cost more than it does currently.
But this is where the consensus breaks down.
Yet they seem to prefer the latter.
The Inspectors Have Failed Us
For the most part, these measures have succeeded.
Because the chemicals are likely to corrode the warhead over time, extended storage has a high probability of leakage and degradation of the weapon.
Any concession will be interpreted as weakness.
The problem is not new.
The International Atomic Energy Agency at 50
The IAEA traces its lineage to the early dark days of the Cold War.
Today, this responsibility extends to more than 180 countries.
In 2003, Libya’s renunciation of its secret weapons revealed how another country had hoodwinked the Agency.
Director General Mohamed El Baradei has called upon the US to negotiate directly with Iran over its atomic program.
He also has attempted to generate momentum for a Middle East nuclear weapons-free zone.
The World in 2030
The final game-changing issue is America’s future role.
All of these issues require cooperation to resolve.
But there are effective approaches to each of them that do not require tracking everyone online, or requiring IDs for every interaction.
We can’t save cyberspace by destroying its openness.
To implement effective security, the entities best equipped to do so, the Internet service providers, must take the lead.
At the same time, all ISPs should implement an e-mail ID system (there are two good standards, called Domain Keys and SPF).
ISPs need to pass these costs on to their customers.
But they won’t, because they compete mostly on price.
These changes would not create some digital nervous system with a centralized brain that could solve all problems.
Indeed, it is now visiting Syria.
Russia has consistently argued that only Security Council resolutions, not General Assembly resolutions, are binding international law.
Other interventions – for example, in Somalia – did not.
But we should recall Mark Twain’s story about his cat.
After sitting on a hot stove, it would never sit on a hot stove again, but neither would it sit on a cold one.
The Iowa Caucuses and the Atlantic Alliance
The most egregious examples of this view were statements made by the political scientists John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt.
If Washington could live with a nuclear Soviet Union, a nuclear China, and even a nuclear North Korea, then it can live with a nuclear Iran.
He is too busy being directly engaged in the attempt to eliminate the deadly threat that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose to the Jewish state.
More important, was the decision to invade rightly made?
Indeed, the evidence that was presented publicly was thin and exaggerated.
It is one thing to guide people up a mountain; it is another to lead them to the edge of a cliff.
Among Sunnis, only 23% thought so.
Kurds exceeded this number, with 95% claiming an improvement.
The comparable figures for Shi’ites were 10 and 14%, respectively, but were just 4% and 5%, respectively, for Sunnis.
They offer the possibility for the Sunni community to participate in the new system.
The Irrepressible 1930’s
Almost no one remembers that President Franklin Roosevelt tried the same thing in 1933.
Fisher provided a new rationale for an old practice of debasing the coinage called seignorage.
One day, they increased it by $0.21, since 21 seemed like a lucky number.
By then, several hundred million dollars had been pumped into the banking system.
Buying foreign gold did succeed in driving down the dollar’s value in terms of gold.
What is the source of the problem?
Things were better long ago.
The first Turkish ruler to reign over the Ecumenical Patriarchate was Mehmed II, the Ottoman Sultan who conquered Constantinople in 1453.
That’s why the late Ottoman bureaucracy and the Ottoman Parliament included a great number of Greeks, Armenians and Jews — something you never see in republican Turkey.
The Halki Seminary, opened in 1844, is a relic from that bygone age of pluralism.
The latter had cheered the Greek armies when they invaded western Anatolia in 1919.
The real motive behind this is the regime’s distaste for Islam.
“The Islamists! They want this, because they want to open Islamic schools as well.”
The reason that Islam seems like a religion of the "other" to Western eyes is that the West has witnessed a systematic de-institutionalization of religion.
Who has the authority to interpret religious texts?
But social mobility is also a precondition for creating a modern outlook.
All Western Muslims possess a double sense of belonging, a double cultural capital.
The IT Boom Was a Myth Only in Europe
New information technologies account for perhaps 80% of the acceleration in US productivity.
It remained constant in France and Germany, while going up by 0.66% in the US. 
Some of the data suggest that European performance was particularly disappointing in the sectors that are  intensive users of IT.
Moreover, the hi-tech sectors that  produce IT, and that typically grow faster than the rest of the economy, are much smaller and less dynamic in Europe than in the US. 
With regard to IT  use , Europe has spent a lot of money investing in IT, but often not for productive purposes.
Perhaps this has to do with other differences between Europe and the US.
West Africa’s jewel is fracturing.
The Ivory Coast miracle is now the Ivory Coast hell, where natives and non-natives live in fear.
Last November, for example, seven French soldiers were killed in a regime-ordered air raid against the northern rebels.
Rwanda’s horrors, and more recently Darfur, come quickly to mind.
At first sight, the Ivory Coast’s post-colonial history looks like a variation on standard themes.
Independence from France (in 1960) spawned a dictatorship remarkable mainly for its longevity.
The division of the country into more ethnically homogeneous federal components might also promote stability.
But that will require strong international supervision, resembling today’s EU Protectorate in Bosnia.
The Japan Myth
The Jewish Conspiracy in Asia
Perhaps this is how Jewish conspiracy theories were passed on as well.
Hence the idea that Jews run America.
They, too, have been persecuted for not being “sons of the soil.”
This was good for the Jews of Shanghai.
British Airways, for example, has asked workers to work for an entire month without pay.
The Judicial Massacre of Srebrenica
The massacre was prepared in detail and took place over the course of six days (between July 13 and 19).
And it’s not just the US.
Obesity is on the increase in Mexico.
Fat-related diabetes is becoming epidemic in India.
Everywhere you look, from Buffalo to Beijing, you can see ballooning bellies.
In general, silos are bursting. 
Lots of food means lots of grease, and meat, and sugar, and calories.
You heard me right.
A first demonstration was made 100 years ago.
Carl Bosch, a young genius working for a chemical company, quickly ramped up Haber’s process to industrial levels.
They both won Nobel Prizes. 
If you don’t think this work important, consider that half the nitrogen in your body is synthetic, a product of a Haber-Bosch factory.
The Key to Stability in South Asia
The Keynes-Hayek Rematch
What is the right response to a collapse?
So policy will have to change.
Perhaps the best way to look at the situation is to recall that three locomotives have driven the world economy over the past 15 years.
The first was heavy investment, centered in the United States, owing to the information technology revolution.
The third was manufacturing investment elsewhere in the world – predominantly in Asia – as the US became the world economy’s importer of last resort.
So we will have to rely on other sources of aggregate demand.
The first source is the government.
It is certainly less clear than the previous story, which cannot be retold.
So, what one should be looking for is movement in the right directions, which are fairly clear.
The Khmer Rouge in the Dock
This may be about to change.
In order to ensure a credible process, Cambodia and the UN must select judges of the highest caliber, not those that toe a party line.
Their many victims will rightly seek some form of accounting - at a minimum, an official record of the crimes they suffered.
The Khmer Rouge prosecutions will not be perfect.
But they are necessary.
The Killings in Colombia
The Kindness of Strangers
One powerful force is the use of language to tell stories.
As Robert Wright has emphasized, as people become increasingly inter-dependent, the scope of moral concern expands accordingly.
It feels good to be good.
As moral creatures, we are driven to enforce justice.
This is the flip side of charity.
We are motivated to be kind to anonymous others, but we are also motivated to harm those who treat these anonymous others badly.
The extension of human morality is a wonderful development for humanity, but it would be even better if it were tempered by cold-blooded rationality.
The Kingdom and the Afghan Chaos
In October 2006, for example, Mecca was used to host talks among Iraq’s warring sectarian factions.
In February 2007, the short-lived Palestinian government of national unity was created as the result of a summit there.
The Saudis even invited Taliban officials – including Mullah Omar – to perform the Hajj .
The Kingdom has suffered from the rise of the Shi’a in neighboring Iraq and is keen to maintain Sunni supremacy in the Islamic lands further to the east.
Culturally, ethnically, and linguistically, Afghans are more closely related to Iranians than they are to Arabs.
The Kingdom Betrayed?
Who, Abdullah wonders, will keep the Iranian wolf from the Kingdom’s door?
The Knife’s-Edge Economy
The situation had to resolve itself within a year – or else.
Here we are, fully a year later, and things are still balanced on the knife’s edge.
Jobs are moving from construction (and related occupations) into tradable goods and services production (and related occupations).
But the hour was growing late.
But what kind of role?
That title belongs to the Italian legal theorist Mario Bettati.
But he is best known as its champion.
Jimmy Carter boycotted the Moscow Olympics.
Things could not be more different now.
The presidential term has been extended.
PARIS – What is the significance of France’s recent sale of four powerful Mistral-class warships to Russia?
France does not share Germany’s natural closeness to Russia – a relationship based on both geography and history.
France is keen to maintain its independent arms industry, and to keep open its naval arsenal, based in Saint-Nazaire on the West coast.
The first one is paving the way for the second to return to the Kremlin in 2012.
In Russia, power is money and money is power.
MOSCOW: Will the sinking of the submarine Kursk and the death of all its crew also sink the Putin revolution?
Between October and December over 40% of our country’s governorships will be up for grabs in new elections.
In some places, the Chelyabinsk region, for example, it is up a whopping 25% on a year ago.
A democratic "feel good" factor is in play.
People do not care a bit about ideology.
The Language of Genomics
Genes are, in a sense, the instruction language for building humans (or any other living thing).
And language is symbols that interact to build meaning.
And, yes, of course, it was the same Cliff Reid I knew back in the late 1980’s.
There is a huge amount of information in there, but we can’t understand it.
Imagine getting a copy of Tolstoi’s War and Peace in Russian and (assuming you can’t read Russian) trying to figure out the story.
Impossible.
People with BRCA-derived breast cancer benefit from treatment with herceptin, whereas those with other kinds of breast cancer do not.
So, it is no surprise that Reid has found a role in this new marketplace.
We’re just at the beginning of this process, which will take many years.
There is, of course, still a huge amount of data to collect and process, and huge amounts of research and discovery to happen.
The Language of Global Protest
The Bulgarian political scientist Ivan Krastev, for example, has claimed that what we are actually experiencing is 1968 “in reverse.”
No name and no clear interpretation have yet attached itself to the movements.
But how they describe themselves – and how analysts describe them – will make an important difference in the direction they might take.
Nineteen sixty-eight was famously over-theorized.
Put more simply: they were supposed to make it up as they went along.
In that sense, 1968 and today’s protests are not as different as some observers claim.
Still, for all the theoretical weaknesses of Hessel’s treatise, “indignation” has become a watchword for movements in France, Spain, and elsewhere.
The Last Extinction
BONN – Farmers across Africa are currently engaged in an unequal struggle against a pestilent fruit fly whose natural home is in Asia.
In a bid to counter the fly, a team from the world-renowned ICIPE institute in East Africa recently went to Sri Lanka looking for a natural predator.
From May 20-30, governments from more than 190 countries and an estimated 6,000 delegates will meet in Bonn, Germany for the Ninth Meeting of the Parties to the CBD.
Thirty percent of global fish stocks have collapsed, up from roughly 15% in 1987, and the proportion of fish stocks classified as over-exploited has doubled, to around 40%.
Every year, 13 million hectares of tropical forests, which contain up to 80% of the planet’s biodiversity, are destroyed.
Foreign policy is another story.
Blair still does.
Actually, the answer is quite simple.
Indeed, perhaps the greatest of British imperial conquerors in Africa, Cecil Rhodes, once defined imperialism as “philanthropy plus 5%.”
None, so far, seem to have found much favor in the ranks of Barack Obama’s consultants.
Such clout as the neo-cons wielded under Bush is unusual in the political culture of the US, which is noted for its skepticism toward intellectual experiments.
But the idea that it could be enforced by the Imperial Japanese Army running amok through China and Southeast Asia was disastrous.
There is a core of truth in this assertion.
But, in order to succeed, he will have to save some of their ideals from the ruins of their disastrous policies.
The Last of the Tibetans
NEW YORK &#45;&#45; Are the Tibetans doomed to go the way of the American Indians?
Monasteries and temples were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution (often with the help of Tibetan Red Guards).
Nomads were forced to live in ugly concrete settlements.
And the Dalai Lama and his entourage were forced to flee to India.
None of this was peculiar to Tibet.
Regional identity, cultural diversity, and traditional arts and customs have been buried under concrete, steel, and glass all over China.
Even Tibetan intellectuals who want to study their own classical literature must do so in Chinese translation.
Religion is now tolerated in Tibet, as it is in the rest of China, but under strictly controlled conditions.
Monasteries and temples are exploited as tourist attractions, while government agents try to ensure that the monks stay in line.
Its printing press was destroyed.
President Mbeki reacted to Obsanjo's announcement with what South Africa's business weekly, The Financial Mail , described as "surprise and consternation."
The Lawless Sheriff
When abuses occur in one area, they can quickly spread to others.
Why did CBS refuse to release information of vital concern to the public?
Amnesty International held a press conference on the topic in Baghdad in July 2003.
Had the letter and spirit of these safeguards been followed, we would not have been in this war at all, or at least not alone.
The international community tried.
The Lebanese Labyrinth
Let’s start with Syria.
In 2005, President Bashar Assad’s regime was forced to withdraw its army from Lebanon, following the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri.
Yet in a speech soon thereafter, Assad warned that nothing could sever the Syrian-Lebanese relationship.
The court was approved under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and will be situated in Holland.
Closely allied with Syria is Hezbollah, which presides over a virtually autonomous mini-state in south Lebanon.
In the coming weeks, Hezbollah will have to calculate at several levels.
On the other side, interests vary.
Finally, as they maneuver around the shoals of regional and international affairs, the Lebanese must also consider domestic American politics.
The Lebanon War One Year Later
For the Shia are the biggest of Lebanon’s three religious communities.
Of course, no one wants to break budgets or create dependency.
The Left is in the Streets
For the hollowing out of Socialism has a consequence.
To paraphrase Marx, a specter is haunting Europe – the specter of chaos.
BRUSSELS – Interest in small countries’ economic policies is usually confined to a small number of specialists.
The recovery could only be partial, because the previous level of output was unsustainable, but it was enough to allow the government to balance its books again.
Does Iceland constitute a counter-example to Latvia?
In contrast to Latvia, Iceland let its currency, the krona, devalue massively.
Moreover, Iceland’s public debt/GDP ratio now stands at 100%, compared to only 42% in Latvia.
The Lessons of Liberia
In Liberia's capital city of Monrovia last month, young men began to riot because full funding was not yet in place for the UN's disarmament program.
Effective peace-building cannot wait for slow fundraising.
Perestroika had no such historic precedent.
Thus, perestroika took place in a void.
Much of what socialism built needed to be undone.
One reason that Russia’s reform debates are so barren is the country’s lack of coherent political parties.
Simply put, the government must meet the people halfway.
The Lessons of South Africa
South Africa is now beginning to contemplate the retirement of Thabo Mbeki, its second president since the end of the apartheid era.
There were many occasions when South Africa’s fate appeared touch and go. But catastrophe was avoided.
All South Africans were traumatized by apartheid.
Nelson Mandela was released in February 1990.
By avoiding the truth of the Soviet past, Russians have stored up trouble for the future.
A crime can never be buried.
We have not forgotten what was done to ordinary black people in the name of apartheid.
The Meaning of Cyprus
The proceeds were then invested in Greek government bonds and loans to Greek companies.
When Greece imploded, the investments turned sour, and the Cypriot banks that had engaged in this strategy became insolvent.
Their bad assets will be separated and wound down over time.
This fear may now ease.
The crisis in Cyprus represents an extreme and special case in many respects.
Indeed, what was not discussed in the candidates’ debate on foreign policy was more significant than what was.
Issues like the eurozone’s troubles and relations with Russia received no attention at all.
The gravest omission was climate change.
That, obviously, is something that every patriotic American wants.
Obama also mentioned that he had raised fuel-economy standards for cars in the US, and had invested in renewable energy sources, like solar and wind power.
The Lessons of the World Cup
Indeed, London’s Arsenal football club is composed entirely of foreigners, including a French coach.
Christiano Zanetti, an Argentine, is captain of Inter Milan.
Football thus provides a glimpse of how true globalization of labor would work.
No limits were ever imposed on players’ movements, except by Communist countries.
Consider the number of clubs that have qualified for the European Champions’ League top eight slots.
The bottom line is simple: fewer and fewer clubs are making it into the European elite.
Since the English Premier League was started in 1992, only one championship was not won by Manchester United, Arsenal, or Chelsea.
In Italy, all but two Serie A championships since 1991 have been won by either Juventus or AC Milan.
In Spain, all but three championships since 1985 have been won by either Real Madrid or Barcelona.
The reason for this concentration at the top is obvious: the richest clubs are now able to attract the best players in the world.
When the best players play together, the quality of each, and of the team as a whole, increases exponentially.
The same is true of all games played at the final tournament, not only those among the top eight national teams.
A good Danish or Bulgarian player improves much faster if he joins Manchester United or Barcelona.
The same rule could be applied to other activities.
For Russians, America was an evil empire, the world of capitalist exploitation and a nuclear superpower, but also a cradle of economic prosperity and individual freedom.
And it really is all about whom you know, and how you know them.
The time to implement such a strategy is long overdue.
In recognition of this, China has stepped up its efforts to mend fences.
State broadcaster CCTV will launch a worldwide program to explain the Chinese position on international affairs.
Cultivating high expectations without progress could even be dangerous.
SHANGHAI – China’s economy is at a crossroads.
Multinational companies have created nearly 1,000 R&amp;D centers in China, including 194 in 2010 alone, enabling them to develop products for the local market.
China is the world’s top manufacturing country by output.
Moreover, the quality of Chinese-manufactured products continues to lag behind that of developed countries’ manufactured goods.
The Limits of Democracy
In particular, they do not create a liberal order.
There must be certain accepted rules of the political game that are binding on all, so that whoever does not accept or obey them is disqualified.
Once the rules of the game are set, there still remains the question: who enforces them?
In sovereign states and territories, this is highly unlikely to come about on its own.
Some say that it is achieved only once a country has passed the “two-turnover test,” that is, two changes of government without violence.
The Limits of Dubai
What exactly did investors expect when they purchased bonds in companies with names like “Limitless World,” one of Dubai World’s bankrupt real-estate subsidiaries?
Talk about a bubble mentality.
Unfortunately, Dubai ultimately proved subject to the laws of financial gravity.
Is this the end of the road for Dubai’s epic growth?
Not just yet.
But investors are learning the hard way that no country’s possibilities and resources are limitless.
This is nicely illustrated in identical twins, who show as they age increasing differences in the way that their identical DNA is marked by the environment.
For example, it is now possible to analyze the DNA of an unborn child from the blood of its mother and determine its risk for diseases later in life.
But they are more limited in number and scope than many seem to believe.
So extensive is this process that it sometimes appears as a “legislative tornado.”
Importing laws and legal standards has dominated attempts by former communist countries to join the West.
Is this effort worthwhile?
For centuries, Western law arrived with colonial rulers.
American antitrust law, when transplanted to Japan after World War II by General MacArthur, for example, led to only six criminal prosecutions in thirty years.
Three factors are at work here:
- Application and enforcement of rules is determined by the perceptions of both users and law enforcers.
Voluntary compliance in turn depends on the perception and acceptance of rules by domestic constituencies in the country that imported a law.
Still, not all transplants fail.
Standardization of laws could be intended as a signal to international investors.
Investors need to take account of the effectiveness of domestic legal institutions, not just the laws on the books.
Under the circumstances, my government took hard decisions and took them quickly.
Ghana was the first sub-Saharan nation to win its independence from a colonial power, in 1957.
Electricity prices, for instance, have doubled, while fuel for cars has risen 64%.
To adapt the Chinese proverb, we want help to learn how to fish, rather than to be given fish for food.
We want Ghana to become a beacon in West Africa.
A decade later, Germany is considered a role model for everyone else.
But expenditure was cut by five percentage points of GDP during the next five years.
Manufacturing productivity increased somewhat, owing to intense international competition.
Those countries that persist with these reform efforts could well emerge leaner and more competitive.
The Only Game in Town
TOKYO – What should central banks do when politicians seem incapable of acting?
Central banks can play an important role in a cyclical downturn.
Central banks can also play a role when financial markets freeze up.
The benefits have been commensurately smaller.
All too often, the process does not end smoothly but in a crash.
But is it true?
Variant CJD was first described in 1996, following intensive surveillance activities undertaken by the UK National CJD Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) in Edinburgh.
Later investigations have shown that the transmitting agent in variant CJD shares identical biological properties with BSE’s agent, supporting a causal relationship.
If the epidemic were in decline, it might be anticipated that the average age of the patients would increase in the final stages (as occurred with cattle in the UK that were infected with BSE).
Nutrition for Growth
That is all the more important because a new baby boom is taking place – not in the United States or Europe, but in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.
In Africa, most food is produced by women smallholder farmers.
Rising sea levels would explain a lot of geological and economic events.
What is this theory anyway?
But if that were the problem, one would cause all prices – including, say, clothing and haircuts – to rise.
But, once again, the data do not bear this out.
The use of the term has grown in parallel with rising , not falling, interest rates.
Yet another theory is that changes in our ways of handling risk have reduced risk premia.
It could even be called an approximate synonym for “bubbly.”
The term “awash with liquidity” was also used often in 1999 and 2000, just before the major peak in the stock market.
Beggar Thy Currency Or Thy Self?
The US auto industry is up in arms.
So where is the global economy headed?
It is against this background that the International Monetary Fund has released its updated forecasts and assessment of the global economy.
In conclusion, the recovery continues, but it is not on solid ground.
We do not think that this points to a double-dip recession.
The Long Decline of Western Europe?
So politicians on the campaign trail promise the impossible: reforms that will produce instant prosperity at no cost to anyone.
Does this mean that Europe -- at least continental Western Europe -- is doomed?
Not necessarily.
Germany, France, and Italy are rich countries.
The Long March in Nepal
The people of Nepal have more than one reason to celebrate.
The reasons are simple.
The reason is simple.
Iran is already one of the Middle East’s most powerful countries.
But it is possible that Iran will reject any diplomatic compromise, even one put forward directly by the US.
It is the worst sort of choice, as neither option is attractive.
Some countries, like Angola, are contracting.
Elsewhere, the crisis has swept away the benefits of several years of economic reform.
Many Africans will fall back into desperate poverty.
But it did no good.
Spearheaded by the economist Peter Bauer in the 1980’s, it became the nostrum of the Washington Consensus.
The most interesting contemporary contribution is by the Oxford economist Paul Collier.
Typically, these are projects that employ international expertise under domestically issued mandates.
However, as long as there is a roadblock every 14 kilometers between Lagos and Abidjan – two of West Africa’s leading cities – progress on the ground will be slow.
The Lost Wealth of Nations
Global warming is a case in point.
What is true about individuals is even truer of groups.
Indeed, no moral benefit can be derived from evoking the past if we fail to realize our group's shortcomings or errors. But doing so is problematic.
At the Smithsonian, the Enola Gay was to play a central role in an exhibition meant to depict the Hiroshima bombing in all its complexity.
However, due to the pressure of various US patriotic groups, the exhibition was canceled, because it was seen as an offense against memory.
Computers and the Internet made it possible to send information almost costlessly, and to do business across cultures and continents.
Hockey stick curves often occur in nature.
Information technology is growing at a faster pace than 5%.
According to "Moore's Law" -- named after the president of Intel, who formulated it in 1975 -- the amount of components on a computer chip doubles every two years.
Fears about computers eliminating jobs are, of course, not new.
The economic problems that Wiener worried about have not materialized so far .
Powerful new computers will make the human race as a whole better off.
Older information technology has already created "winner-take-all" effects in some occupations.
But phonographs and television are limited compared to what is possible now - or may be possible soon.
What that will mean for these countries, and for the region, is one of today’s central geopolitical questions.
But these governments have much work to do at home first.
These governments’ first major test of economic stewardship will be how they treat the tourism industry.
Islamist parties will now have enormous influence on economic policy, after decades of official separation of mosque and state.
Autumn’s Known Unknowns
The looming known unknowns are plentiful.
Some outcomes may be more positive, or at least less damaging, than expected.
And the meta-risk of policy mistakes and accidents remains very high.
The Making of a Murder in Pakistan
Her first stint as prime minister (1988-90) was brief and disorganized.
The Making of China’s Trade Deficit
But, like any other large economy, China’s economy is driven by domestic consumption and investment.
But domestic demand, which determines imports, consists not only of consumption, but also of fixed-asset investment.
That is exactly what is happening in China now.
The problem currently is that a trade deficit has emerged at a time when the national saving rate is as high as 51%.
Symbols and examples can be very effective.
But the symbolism of Gandhi’s simple dress and lifestyle spoke louder than words.
T.E. Lawrence (“Lawrence of Arabia”) also understood how to communicate with symbols.
In addition to communicating with distant audiences, leaders need the ability to communicate one-on-one or in small groups.
In some cases, that close communication is more important than public rhetoric.
Ronald Reagan was a master of the well selected anecdote.
The Making of International Monetary Reform
Many, especially in Asia and the Persian Gulf, are de facto linked to the dollar, others to the euro.
So we need what the jargon calls “surveillance.”
The analogy is apt.
The Making of Sputnik
MOSCOW &#45;&#45; On October 4, 1957, my father, Nikita Khrushchev, awaited a telephone call.
Earlier that day, my father was in Kyiv, Ukraine, on military business.
Soviet engineers began designing Sputnik in January 1956.
The plan was to launch it with the R-7, an intercontinental ballistic missile in development since 1954.
In August and September, R-7 missiles were successfully launched twice.
There were no banner headlines or enthusiastic comments.
After all, we – not the Americans – had opened the world’s first nuclear power plant.
The Soviet MiG set world records in the 1950’s, and the Soviet Tu-104 was the most efficient airliner of its class.
The committee requested it from the Soviet government.
As my father saw it, you could order scientists and engineers to work together, but you couldn't force them to create something.
Korolev was offended but kept silent.
In their “secret” world, it wasn’t any secret who was behind the title “Chief Designer.”
Even my father couldn’t make peace between them.
The Malaysian Miracle
The numbers themselves say a lot.
At independence, Malaysia was one of the poorest countries in the world.
There were many reasons not to have expected Malaysia to be a success.
Malaysia is rich in natural resources.
How, then, does an economist account for Malaysia’s success?
The Malleable Mr. Medvedev
He is a fluent English speaker who does not have a secret-service background and has been dealing with the West for almost a decade as the Russian energy industry’s leading figure.
In fact, Medvedev will be Russia’s most malleable leader since Tsar Nicholas II.
Gazprom itself will continue to operate as a non-commercial actor.
Putin was a wolf, but at least he – unlike Medvedev – dressed the part.
The Malthus Gun
The introduction of molecular methods began the current agricultural revolution.
No holes, no fungi, no mycotoxins.
It has been developing for decades.
Water and arable land are in short supply.
The climate is changing.
Unexpectedly, we find ourselves once again staring down the barrel of Malthus’ gun.
There is much room for increasing productivity.
Despite the bad rap they’ve gotten, the GM crops in use today have already contributed to meeting both challenges.
The Man Who Made Malaysia
Both began their careers as Malay nationalists who sought to promote the rights of the Malay majority after the British left.
Against most international advice, Mahathir imposed capital controls and a fixed exchange rate for the ringgit to buy time for recovery.
Mahathir, the first commoner to be Malaysian prime minister, became a leading Asian modernizer in another fundamental way, as well.
He will not want Malaysia to fall far behind.
The “semi-conductor chips versus potato chips” debate also underlined a different point.
In short, it is what you “consume,” not what you produce, that influences what sort of person you will be and how that affects your economy and your society.
It surely had not occurred to me that England grew its own oranges.”
But this does not follow.
Even if you wanted to curtail financial services, you could still focus on the multitude of non-financial services.
The Manufacturing Imperative
Industrialization was the driving force of rapid growth in southern Europe during the 1950’s and 1960’s, and in East and Southeast Asia since the 1960’s.
But these gains have come at the expense of – and to some extent because of – industry rationalization and employment reductions.
The artificial heart machine, also known as a left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, has been used to keep patients alive until they receive a heart transplant.
It is morally wrong.
The Many Faces of the Arab Spring
Monarchies – in Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and most of the Gulf dynasties – still appear to their subjects to be more acceptable than secular autocracies.
Of course, the Arab monarchies are not entirely immune to the threat of popular uprisings.
The March of Folly in Afghanistan
Or is the war in Afghanistan really now about countering the insurgents fighting Hamid Karzai’s government?
It is, of course, good that the US no longer thinks that Afghanistan can be transformed into some Jeffersonian democracy on the Hindu Kush.
Only when the ruling “emir” in Kabul demonstrates understanding, tolerance, and strength do Afghan unity and a sort of peace prevail.
The March of Scientific Folly
Hence, theoretical schemes were extended beyond reason.
Thus, the circle is closed.
In the above example, absent-mindedness is first a symptom of a subconscious feeling.
Nothing, indeed, resisted the psychoanalytic exegesis.
Politics, sociology, history, or medicine: all were grist for the psychoanalyst's mill.
Biology was no exception.
Soviet science was set back fifty years.
The genome contains the complete set of instructions, and is therefore named The Holy Grail, The Bible, The Book of Man.
In other words, a man or a woman is more than his or her psyche; more than his or her biochemistry; and more than his or her social identity.
Assuredly, Man is more than his genes.
He is also his past, his present and his future.
First, because it is, above all, a form of political representation, it can have its own local particularities.
In other words, although a caudillo ’s charisma matters, he or she is a social creation.
President Rafael Correa of Ecuador looks like he also wants to move in the same direction.
The March to Barbarism
The United States seems as capable of barbarism as anyone else, as the abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison make clear.
False.
There seem to be two common characteristics of the descent into barbarism.
The first is the relentless human tendency to classify the world as "us" versus "them," and then to reduce "them" to sub-human status.
Fear leads one group to coalesce in order to protect itself, perhaps by attacking a competing group.
In May 2004, The New York Times polled readers in a city in the US heartland, Oswego, Illinois.
Let's wipe them off the face of the earth."
They're the ones who are dangerous.
The UN process worked.
CAMBRIDGE – A specter is haunting Europe – the specter of “market confidence.”
That much is clear.
The pursuit of market confidence would be superfluous.
But what is it?
This is where European governments (along with their economist advisors) have kept missing the boat.
The Marx Renaissance
PRINCETON – Karl Marx has returned, if not quite from the grave then from history’s dustbin.
When opening a new building at the London School of Economics, the Queen of England asked why no one had predicted the crisis.
In other words, the financial world has reached a kind of carnival season, in which fools are wise and clever people turn out to be idiots.
The “Marxist” revival was probably an inevitable byproduct of the current crisis.
The Mauritius Miracle
But Mauritius, a small island nation off the east coast of Africa, is neither particularly rich nor on its way to budgetary ruin.
Surely, this must be some “trick.”
During my visit, my interest was to understand better what had led to what some have called the Mauritius Miracle, and what others might learn from it.
The question, rather, is how to organize society.
This is not to say that Mauritius is without problems.
Almost surely, Mauritius, too, will have to intervene.
The Mauritius Miracle dates to independence.
KYIV – It began as a grey and muddy spring day, like so many others in my homeland.
It ended in dread and mourning.
Of course, none of us knew the precise moment when catastrophe struck at Chernobyl 25 years ago.
I remember the abject fear I felt for my young daughter.
Anger can actually be artistically and politically creative.
PRINCETON – An information war has erupted around the world.
The contest is being waged institutionally in organizations like the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and daily in countries like Syria.
Because broadcasting requires significant funding, it is more centralized – and thus much more susceptible to state control.
The presumption should be that governments with nothing to hide have nothing to lose by allowing their citizens and internationally recognized media to report on their actions.
And 70% of Americans believe that patients hospitalized for a mental illness may be dangerous.
Indeed, while mentally ill people may be more likely to commit violent acts if they are not treated, or are misusing alcohol or drugs, the risk is small.
The perception that mentally ill people are dangerous is global.
In Tunisia, the largest newspaper has a circulation of roughly 50,000 in a country of 10 million people.
A few years ago, under Saddam Hussein, an Iraqi could have his tongue cut out if he was found in possession of a satellite dish or used the Internet without government approval.
In the meantime, innocent lives were lost.
But we have begun to adapt.
Yet this has been portrayed as “buying news.”
The resulting explosion of critical press stories then causes everything – all activity, all initiative – to stop.
During the Cold War, institutions such as Radio Free Europe proved to be valuable instruments.
The Mediterranean Crucible
But many Europeans’ sunny view of the region has yielded to lowering clouds of pessimism.
Europe, as Tunisia’s northern neighbor, will be directly affected either way, and should therefore become seriously involved in terms of promoting democracy and aiding economic progress.
Protests on its southern shores have now begun the process of bringing democracy to this region.
The changes in the world’s balance of power from the West to the East, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, is making both the United States and Europe apprehensive.
More than half the containers bound for Milan from the Far East are unloaded in northern European ports.
Although this infrastructure is financed mainly by individual EU member states using their own funds, the TEN-T is binding and marks out the priority projects for each member.
Calderón took office in December 2006 under adverse circumstances.
This watered-down gradualism has become his trademark.
Ultimately, this is what he will be judged by.
Mexico was then a producer of heroin and marijuana, and a transit country for cocaine from South America.
Does he really control the murky financial resources of the PLO, which gave Arafat so much real power beyond the formal title of head of the Palestinian Authority?
What, then, can be achieved?
The Middle East’s Democratic F-Words
LONDON – The Middle East continues to have the highest concentration of dictatorships in the world.
For example, Yemen is now a failed state.
Its political institutions have ceased to function, leading to civil war in its north and separatism in the country’s south.
The region’s flexible states are frightened of war.
Can that happen without democratization?
The Middle East’s Feminist Revolution
So where were these women in Tunisia and Egypt?
The greatest shift is educational.
Today, women account for more than half of the students at Egyptian universities.
The Middle East’s Five Crises
The difficult south will sooner or later return to Pashtun politics.
This will only work where there is security for the local population.
So the new American president will have to take the lead in 2009.
This would also be the case if Israel unleashed its Air Force against Iran’s nuclear installations.
The 1967 war is one example.
Today’s tragedy is that we are receding from this possible agreement.
Yet broad Palestinian public opinion is on the side of compromise.
It, too, is playing into the hands of extremists by fighting terrorism with military rather than political means.
A Palestinian legislature and cabinet have opened, as well as Palestinian police and security services.
What will be the status of Jerusalem?
What will be the future of Jewish settlements?
Should they stay, be partly evacuated, or be put partly under Palestinian rule?
The Middle East’s New Game
It also puts at risk Turkey’s robust economic penetration into Arab markets.
The Middle East’s Springtime of Democracy
Will they tolerate dissent?
By my count, some two-thirds of the 1.4 billion Muslims in the world now live under elected governments in which Islamist parties are players.
In the years since, Islamists have participated in four Jordanian elections.
In the 1970’s, the Helsinki Accord helped bring down the Soviet Empire.
We need a comparable formula for the Middle East.
The Middle Kingdom’s Middle Class
The reasons that are usually cited are China’s compelling demographic, geographic, and broad cultural factors.
Some of these characteristics are more culturally specific than Joseph Schumpeter’s description of entrepreneurship as a process of “creative destruction” might imply.
But boldness and adaptability do accord with Schumpeter’s emphasis on forming new combinations and doing things in new ways.
·        A high degree of strategic adaptability.
Since China never established male primogeniture, this meant that when he died, each son could have his own business to start with.
Only some three million of these businesses gained sufficient size and organization to form limited-liability corporations that issued shares.
Their relatively small companies and their efficient decision-making processes allow them to remain nimble and to react quickly.
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) rises to the opportunity.
We are those fish.
The LHC will allow us to discern the microscopic structure of the universal medium.
The simplest idea is that it is made out of one new kind of particle, the so-called “Higgs particle,” but I suspect that there is more to it.
The augmented equations, today known as the Maxwell equations, described a unified theory of electricity and magnetism.
Today we call those disturbances radio waves, microwaves, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, x-rays, and gamma rays.
We use them to communicate, cook, and diagnose and cure disease.
This jumble recalls the piecemeal equations of electricity and magnetism before Maxwell.
Some of us have proposed expanded equations that unify the different forces.
These expanded equations, which incorporate an idea called supersymmetry, predict many new effects.
First, the data refer to those from 15 to 24 years old.
But this age group consists of two sub-groups with very different characteristics.
Fortunately, this group is rather small (and has been declining in size over time).
To be sure, a youth unemployment ratio of 13% or 19% is not grounds for complacency.
As any pilot knows, flying without radar or accurate weather forecasts is likely to end in a crash.
The Misconduct of Science?
Indeed, while the menace of misconduct has been exaggerated, we have to rethink how we conduct science – its values, virtues, and shortcomings.
As T.S. Eliot put it, “Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?
But perhaps we should consider it a stroke of luck that these geniuses created their mess somewhere else.
Consider India, where growth is now running at an annualized rate of 4.5%, down from 7.7% annual growth in 2011.
Economic forecasts rest on the assumption that economies ultimately heal themselves.
This time is different, argues the chorus of China skeptics.
At the same time, the contribution from investment surged from 2.3 percentage points of GDP growth in the first quarter of 2013 to 5.9 percentage points in the second quarter.
The wheels of rebalancing are turning.
Over the next 60 years, genetics may be another.
They claim that this knowledge will help you live longer and better.
We need not become too alarmed yet.
This is not new.
The most alarming implication of this mode of genetic selection, however, is that only the rich will be able to afford it.
For example, Aristotle in the third century BC and Ptolemy in the second century AD incorrectly attributed the illusion to the magnifying properties of the atmosphere.
In the nineteenth century, it became clear that the Moon Illusion is psychological, a consequence of the cognitive processes underlying the human brain's visual space perception.
The SDIH is sometimes assumed to be a fundamental law of visual perception.
This is also why the illusion has sometimes been called "paradoxical."
Since observation contradicts the hypothesis, modern explanations of the Moon Illusion have proposed a variety of changes to the SDIH.
Thus, the moon may appear more distant to people who say: "The moon looks close."
Clearly, motion was an essential feature.
Our visual systems evolved in an environment that contained (mostly) rigid moving objects.
Objects that move radially, i.e., directly toward or away from a viewer, produce a stimulus on the eye that is continuously increasing or decreasing in size.
Now, how would such a perceptual system respond to the stimulus of the Moon Illusion - a stimulus that changes only in the elevation of the Moon over the ground?
Accordingly, when the object appears to be at different distances, the perceived size of the object must change.
This makes the moon that appears closer (i.e., the moon at the horizon) also appear larger than the moon that appears farther away.
Out of nostalgia, perhaps?
That’s all very nice, but since the days of Stern’s grandfather, we have made progress in time-keeping.
He termed this “conspicuous consumption.”
Adam Smith wrote that “consumption is the sole end and purpose of production.” But consumption is not an ethical aim.
You need to consume in order to live, and to consume more than you strictly need in order to live well.
People can decide when to stop consuming or what they want to consume.
When it comes to morality, diplomats are usually seen as cold and calculating.
You cannot do business with the Great Satan.
The amoral approach has been Europe's main tradition since the Thirty Years War.
Naturally, several qualifications apply.
How you define your interests reflects how you define your country.
The Soviet Union and America had similar interests at the end of the Second World War.
Nobel laureate Gary Becker disagrees.
This includes capital punishment.
I support executing some people convicted of murder because – and only because – I believe that it deters other murders.
Serious empirical research on capital punishment in the US began with a pioneering study by Isaac Ehrlich, published in 1975 in the American Economic Review.
As David Hume put it in discussing suicide, “no man ever threw away life, while it was worth living.
And this process has been strengthened enormously with the development of DNA identification.
Aside from the legal issues, is there a moral case for non-proliferation?
Suppose it were 1939, and states were debating whether the US should invent the bomb.
They might have argued that all should get it or none.
For example, the purposes should be limited to self- defense.
In addition, the more states possess nuclear weapons, the greater the prospects that terrorists will gain access to them.
The Morning After Israel’s Vote
Each group is finely divided among itself in a dynamic crisscross of creeds and interests, ideals and appetites.
Okay, three parties.
But that’s that.
It’s the only way out of a dangerous impasse at a dangerous historical moment.
Prime ministers will be able to rule full-term with comfortable majorities.
The Mosque and Its Enemies
The second, more invidious assumption of the opponents of Park 51 concerns what happened in September 2001.
In any case, disputes over these policies are far from a theological conflict.
MANAGUA – Like thousands of Nicaraguans, I voted for Managua’s mayor in local elections last November.
As a result, politics in Nicaragua is fraying dangerously once more.
But he has lost the battle for political legitimacy.
The Muslim Civil War
They see Arab (not Shiite) blood being shed, with only Hezbollah fighting back.
Lives versus Profits
You own your genes.
But a Utah-based company, Myriad Genetics, claims more than that.
Blocking such testing costs lives. Myriad is a true example of an American corporation for which profit trumps all other values, including the value of human life itself.
A poorly designed patent system – like the one we have now – can inhibit follow-on research.
This has been true of all of the transformative discoveries and innovations – DNA, transistors, lasers, the Internet, and so on.
The 7/7 bombings in 2005 in my home city of London brought this into sharp relief.
The Myth of “Superstar Cities”
Any claim like that will inevitably attract attention.
Real GDP has been increasing at around 3% a year in advanced countries, and even faster recently in many emerging countries.
Indeed, since the industrial revolution, the development of such new urban areas is a central theme in the history of the world.
They held up signs reading “31,” in reference to Article 31 of the Russian constitution, which guarantees freedom of assembly.
A leading critic of the Kremlin and several others were hastily dragged into a police car and driven away.
East Asian examples (South Korea, Taiwan, China) seem to suggest the former.
Still, Russia and China are both large and powerful economies.
Yet these challenges are nothing compared to the momentous tasks of institutional transformation that await authoritarian countries.
But, after his fall, a very different picture emerged.
And, even when they do not doctor the numbers, local officials can game the system in another way.
What increasingly determines an official’s prospects for promotion is his guanxi, or connections.
For those without guanxi, the only recourse is to purchase appointments and promotions through bribes.
The time has come to bury it.
So what?
Trade is just one among the many linkages between the US and European economies that matter.
It makes it easier for politicians to sell their policies, themselves, and their parties.
So the Copenhagen Consensus Center asked Professor Christoph Böhringer and Andreas Keller of the University of Oldenburg to test this claim.
No one wins.
Few of those 192 measures are in fact more than a nuisance.
What about the recent tariffs imposed by the United States on Chinese tires?
Three things explain this remarkable resilience: ideas, politics, and institutions.
The Myth of the “Ownership Society”
So there is actually no Fox pension.
A 401(k) is a heavily tax-favored account in which workers can save money for their retirement.
Yet Tony Snow didn’t.
Snow’s case, I think, holds very important lessons, and not just for the United States.
America has many people who do not set up 401(k) accounts, despite enormous incentives to do so.
The Myth of the China Stock Market
Indeed, only 20 corporate bonds are currently listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
A majority of these are empty or disused.
A survey conducted in 2001 suggests that funds under their management account for about 40% of the market.
At least 150, and perhaps as many as 200, listed firms have been privatized.
But is Iraq really symptomatic of a greater Shia scheme?
More than a hundred followers of Ayad Allawi, Al Sadr, and others have joined their ranks.
Change within the government is also noteworthy.
And what about Iran?
Only 11% identified Iran as the biggest threat to their security.
A stabilization fund has been established, but on a temporary basis.
The world now knows that Axel Weber, the president of the Bundesbank, voted against it.
Weber’s dissenting voice on Greek bond purchases brings that day dramatically closer.
It also exposes a more fundamental problem.
The weight of individual national members of the Governing Council is much greater.
Germany has the same weight as Malta.
The Narrative Structure of Global Weakening
We only know that most of us have heard them many times.
That may seem unlikely: Why should the European crisis be so important elsewhere?
Like a YouTube video, the Greek story went viral.
The intellectual assault on it takes two forms.
As the philosopher Peter Singer has put it, the communications revolution has spawned a “global audience” that creates the basis for a “global ethics.”
Nevertheless, it is difficult to identify any demographic segment in which attachment to the global community outweighs attachment to the country.
The nation-state may be a relic bequeathed to us by the French Revolution, but it is all that we have.
Globalization, it is said, means that nations can no longer control their own affairs.
What does it take to be British or German or American?
This is, for most people, the positive side of the nation state.
It is the context in which we find our liberties safeguarded or destroyed.
But now the nationalist bug has infected the EU itself.
But they have to be open to cooperation and coordination with others.
BUENOS AIRES – The global financial crisis has raised fundamental questions regarding central banks’ mandates.
But this argument neglects an important point.
To ensure a positive outcome, policymakers should develop a fully transparent framework with well-defined “rules of engagement.”
The Necessity of NATO
BRUSSELS – Many years ago, I took my children to visit the sites of the D-Day landings in Normandy.
We saw the beaches whose names echo through history – Omaha, Utah, Juno.
Those beaches remain a memorial to the idea that, together, we can overcome any threat, no matter how great.
It could no more fade away than our desire for freedom could wane.
And in Afghanistan, we are denying a safe haven to extremists.
This is why you need insurance.
Over the next few months, our role will shift from combat to training and mentoring.
The Alliance helps interested partners with defense reform.
I began by noting my personal identification with the bond between North America and Europe.
But this attachment goes deeper than you think.
My own son lives in Illinois, not far from Chicago, with his wife and two children.
Of my four grandchildren, two are European and two are American.
The biggest challenge is that people do not always get the healthcare they need.
Moreover, cultural barriers reduce the wellbeing of those who do not speak the dominant language, especially indigenous communities.
When care is available, it is often inefficient or of substandard quality.
However, the reverse sometimes is achieved, as another study in Paraguay shows.
Inequality is Killing Capitalism
(The Fed raised its benchmark federal funds rate from 1% in 2004 to 5.25% in 2006 and held it there until August 2007).
To answer that, we must look at what was happening to the distribution of income.
The world was getting steadily richer, but the income distribution within countries was becoming steadily more unequal.
In short, recovery cannot be left to the Fed, the European Central Bank, or the Bank of England.
Our current situation requires not a lender of last resort, but a spender of last resort, and that can only be governments.
But, beyond this, we cannot carry on with a system that allows so much of the national income and wealth to pile up in so few hands.
WASHINGTON, DC – In 2009, US President Barack Obama pledged to seek a world without nuclear weapons.
The Nemesis of Turkish Power
So, will a “Turkish Summer” be the first, if not the main, strategic result of the “Arab Spring”?
Is the Middle East faced with a neo-Ottoman Turkey’s irresistible rise to regional power?
In seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe, the “exoticism” of the Ottoman Empire was used as a mirror to project Europeans’ own shortcomings and insecurities.
In France, one spoke of “Turqueries,” such as in Moliere’s play “The Bourgeois Gentilhomme.”
It is a mirror in which the Arab world projects its fears, as well as its hopes.
The “Middle Empire” of the Middle East will no longer remain a sleeping giant.
After all, Turkey is already a functioning democracy.
Bubbles Forever
The Banco de la República, Colombia’s central bank, maintains a home price index for three main cities – Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali.
Maybe the word bubble is used too carelessly.
Eugene Fama certainly thinks so.
As he put it in a 2010 interview with John Cassidy for The New Yorker, “I don’t even know what a bubble means.
These words have become popular.
That seems to be the core of the meaning of the word as it is most consistently used.
But it is not rational.
In fact, a major boom in real stock prices in the US after “Black Tuesday” brought them halfway back to 1929 levels by 1930.
Speculative bubbles do not end like a short story, novel, or play.
There is no final denouement that brings all the strands of a narrative into an impressive final conclusion.
LONDON – So what does 2009 hold in store for us?
The world’s output grew by a factor of forty, water use by nine, energy use by thirteen, and the emission of carbon dioxide by seventeen.
Asia and Europe have experienced sharp falls in fertility rates.
But now the structure is more like the profile of a skyscraper, more or less the same from top to bottom.
This expands educational and employment opportunities.
Change itself accelerates.
It took radio 38 years to reach an audience of 50 million.
Facebook did that in two years.
How does someone like me, at university in the early 1960’s, adapt and cope?
Copenhagen is the venue for the meeting.
It does not want to see its industries outdated and uncompetitive.
Indeed, even in countries with high primary-school completion rates, many young people do not attend secondary school.
Young people account for half of all new HIV infections.
Is it because they are sometimes close to being illiterate even after primary school, or because it is unaffordable?
Today’s employers want highly skilled workers.
The New Bush Doctrine
Now the elections in Iraq are about to be converted into a civil war between a Shi’a-Kurd dominated government and a Sunni insurrection.
That is the concept that guides me in my efforts to foster freedom around the world.
In short, we may be wrong.
A better understanding of the concept of open society requires that promoting freedom and democracy and promoting American values and interests be distinguished.
But intervention in other states’ internal affairs must be legitimate, which requires clearly established rules.
China’s New Path
One surprise was the decision to retain Zhou Xiaochuan as Governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC).
Zhou is an intelligent and internationally respected expert on monetary policy and finance.
We can expect more of the same in the coming years.
Of course, a cosmopolitan class is hardly new.
Merton discovered a strong pattern.
The cosmopolitan influential in the town is like the medical specialist; the local influential is like the family doctor.
One must realize that individuals choose whether to play the role of cosmopolitan or local, and how much to invest in that role.
Most importantly, if resentment by the locals emerges, what political consequences will result?
Are we marching forward technologically only to march backward socially?
Recent US economic data reveals four facts:
- America’s poverty rate is at its lowest point in 20 years.
- Unemployment is at its lowest level in 30 years;
True, and this is America’s chief predicament.
The New Face of Fascism
But Russia, Serbia, and Romania probably have a more difficult road ahead in fending off their extremists.
First, unlike the postcommunist countries of Central Europe, they lack Western political and philosophical traditions.
Close ties between the state and their Orthodox churches forged state religions that helped to create a strong sense of national messianism.
But important differences between Russia, Serbia, and Romania should be noted.
The hope of EU membership gives mainstream Romanian politicians and the Romanian public strong incentives not to succumb to nationalist sentiments.
Without implementation, all of the treaties in the world would lead us nowhere.
Importantly, there is already broad agreement on a set of shared goals.
Those goals are achievable.
The challenge is implementation.
The New French Fashion in Civil Rights
NEW YORK – First the Swiss ban minarets.
Feminists, including some women from Muslim backgrounds, have backed the ban, because they regard the custom as degrading.
A Communist member of parliament, André Gerin, warned that terrorism and extremism were “hiding behind the veil.”
But this is still no reason why French women should not be allowed to enter a post office, a bank, a school, or any other public place in a burqa.
Interpreting Islamic tradition is not part of the French government’s brief.
The fact that Europeans can marry only one spouse is both a legal and a cultural norm.
Sometimes it is better to do nothing.
And so could a sense of humor.
This does not have to be hostile, as with the Danish newspaper cartoons.
“Sexiness for everyone: everywhere.”
The New German Problem
The most remarkable transformation of all was that of the Federal Republic of Germany.
But the fact that the system worked for almost everyone was the final buttress holding up the cathedral.
So where is this demand-driven growth?
With private-sector demand stalling, the Employment Commission wants the government to serve as employer of last resort.
There may be little cause for immediate worry.
Those that do relatively better will share three characteristics.
It will be a difficult time for all.
In this respect, one might speak of the “epidemic character” of our contemporary world.
Interdependency is, in fact, mutual dependency – a shared exposure to hazards.
Nothing is completely isolated, and “foreign affairs” no longer exists: everything has become national, even personal.
In such a complex world, not even the strongest is sufficiently protected.
What kind of protection would be appropriate in such a world?
The IMF was created to prevent crises like the current one and in this it has failed.
These reserves are put to better use by assisting the IMF in maintaining an open and stable financial system and prevent crises like these from recurring
There is no restoring fully that order.
The New Middle East Order
Indeed, it goes to the heart of the Saudi state’s authority, owing to the Al Saud royal family’s reliance on Wahhabi Islam to legitimate its rule.
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee has often been presented as a pioneer in making monetary policy transparent.
What would replace it?
Milton Friedman's victory was never as complete as the Keynesians' had been.
Round and round we go.
Subsequent arms-control agreements – the SALT and START pacts – were negotiated and implemented in this context.
More specifically, the question is whether it makes sense to move to a world of less nuclear offense and more missile defense.
First is the end of the Cold War.
A number of countries, including but not limited to North Korea, Iraq and Iran, are developing ballistic missiles and possibly nuclear weapons to go with them.
Leaders of these countries may not be deterred by the same logic that worked vis-ŕ-vis the Soviet Union.
But that silence does not mean that they are over.
For these groups, globalization amounted to redistribution.
This is the group that cynics have termed "Davos man."
The new/old politics is inward-looking and likes the idea of the revival of the nation as a protective bulwark against foreign goods and foreign migrants and foreign ownership.
It is also dangerous and destructive, and was in large part responsible for Europe's hideous politics in the first half of the 20th century.
The New Pharmaceutical Frontier
At the same time, traditional markets are becoming saturated.
Under these circumstances, emerging markets present a new frontier.
Sanofi-Aventis recently announced that it would halve the price of its diabetes drug, Lantus, and cancer treatment, Taxotere, in Indonesia and the Philippines.
The New Public Diplomacy
Public diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships that create an enabling environment for government policies.
But its weakness is its inability to influence how the message is perceived in different cultural settings.
The sender knows what she says, but not always what the targets hear.
Cultural barriers are apt to distort what is heard.
Networked communications, on the other hand, can take advantage of two-way communications and peer-to-peer relations to overcome cultural differences.
The New Revolt of the Masses
America is not France – at least not yet.
America by Proxy?
PARIS – The demise of the Roman Empire resulted from a combination of strategic overreach and excessive delegation of security responsibilities to newcomers.
The reality is more complex.
The US troops that landed on Normandy beaches in June 1944 were animated by a strong sense of mission.
This is particularly true in the Middle East.
The Measurement of Hope
Skeptics point out that we have a hard time delivering new tools to the people who need them.
India, for example, is becoming less dependent on aid, and eventually will not need it.
It funds innovation in the creation of new tools and services, and in their delivery.
Hierarchies are becoming flatter, and knowledge workers respond to different incentives and political appeals.
As Osama bin Laden put it in one of his videos, “when people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by nature they will like the strong horse.”
Hard and soft power can reinforce or undermine each other.
Almost every leader needs a certain degree of soft power.
Thus, in his view, Hitler was not a leader.
If you do it three times, the company falls apart.”
Machiavelli famously said that it is more important for a prince to be feared than to be loved.
And Machiavelli made it clear that hatred is something a prince should carefully avoid.
The Next Bretton Woods
This crisis was “made in America,” in more than one sense. 
We may be at a new “Bretton Woods” moment.
Europe’s sigh of relief at the supposed end of the dispute between Russia and Ukraine over gas pricing was audible here in Kyiv.
RosUkrEnergo was established in the last months of the regime of our former ruler, Leonid Kuchma.
Under the deal agreed this week, it retains that control.
Now that I am not in government, that investigation has been shelved.
That is a recipe for renewed threats, not only to Ukraine, but to EU members like Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the three Baltic states.
The IMF’s current strategic review does not start from scratch.
The reform process was launched at the end of the 1990’s and was continued by former Managing Director Horst Köhler with important initiatives.
The issue of representation is an important component of the IMF’s strategic review.
The Next Industrial Revolution
Many opportunities were created by new technologies, from the internal combustion engine to the micro-chip.
When these three forces align, economic change accelerates and so does economic growth and wealth creation.
The Next Liberation of France
With only 1% of the world’s population, France is the sixth largest economy, ranking fourth in international trade and third in exports of goods and services.
More than 40% of the largest companies quoted on the Paris stock exchange are in foreign hands.
If there is an  exception française , it is that for the past 30 years, the unemployment rate has never fallen below 8.5%.
In the section “Employing workers” of  Doing Business , France ranks 134th, compared to 17th for the UK and first for the US.
The Nine Lives of Daniel Ortega
The Nobel Cult
OSLO &#45;&#45; The dance around the golden Nobel medallion began over a 100 years ago, and is still going strong.
Not until committee strongman C. W. Oseen died in 1944 could the theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli – one of the giants of quantum mechanics – receive a prize.
Conversely, the Academy of Sciences sometimes rebelled against its committees.
Harboring a grudge, one chemist rallied the Academy to block the committee’s recommendation for the Russian Dmitry Mendeleyev, who created the periodic table.
No lone scientist or national team can do this.
Various working groups prepare reports by scrupulously reviewing scientific publications.
The world should respond in three ways.
The Nobel Prize and Einstein\u0027s Ghost
This December 10 th marks the one hundredth anniversary of when the first Nobel Prizes were awarded.
Alfred Nobel died on 10 December 1896.
When his will was opened it was found that he had donated his considerable wealth to creating the prizes that bear his name.
Sweden and Norway were then tied together in a union. 
Since the creation of the Nobel prizes, more than 650 medals and diplomas have been given away in the original prize areas.
A prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel was established by the Bank of Sweden in 1968.
Most of these prizes are connected with scientific breakthroughs, literary masterpieces and attempts to make peace in a violent century. 
At the age of 26, during his ``annus mirabulis'' of 1905, Einstein published three papers that were to influence the entire 20 th century, not only in physics.
As a newly elected member of the Academy, in 1921 he was the first to propose giving to Einstein a Nobel Prize for his work on the photoelectric effect.
This single nomination made the wheels begin to turn in Einstein's favor. 
The Non-Communicable Disease Paradox
WELLINGTON – Albert Einstein is reputed to have said that “everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.”
In much of the world, populations are growing and aging simultaneously.
All else being equal, larger and older populations mean more people with NCDs.
Far less well understood are the epidemiological forces that drive NCD dynamics.
So, contrary to popular belief, the incidence of most NCDs other than diabetes has actually been falling.
Increasing overall disease prevalence has hidden decreasing prevalence of late-stage or complicated disease.
I have called this shift towards the milder end of the NCD spectrum the “severity effect.”
The Non-Crisis of the Euro
In fact, the response has been the opposite.
The implication, then, is a larger euro area, not a smaller one, as more countries see the writing on the wall.
Opinions vary, with some calling for a tough position towards Hamas and others advocating a softer approach.
Some are calling for Fatah leaders to abstain from ministerial roles, whereas others see no reason why one can’t be a leader of a party and the government simultaneously.
The Fatah movement has a long way to go before it becomes a full-fledged political party.
The North Korean Enigma
For one thing, North Korea has “the power of weakness.”
This autumn, he promoted his hitherto little-seen son, Kim Jong-un, to the rank of general, and introduced him at a Communist Party conference.
PARIS – Ever since mankind began to map the world, the north and south poles have fascinated us, both poetically and scientifically.
The serene stillness of the Arctic and Antarctic was a perfect match for human indifference.
Of course, that old indifference was not universal.
This treaty dedicated Antarctica to exclusively peaceful aims.
The nature and content of that treaty were purely diplomatic.
Most importantly, a protocol signed in Madrid in 1991, dealt with protecting the Antarctic environment.
It was not an easy success.
We were bluffing, but our bluff worked.
Indeed, international lawyers who are seeking to define the legal status of outer space – Who will own the moon?
But Antarctica had one great advantage, as compared to the Arctic, which is now in peril: there were only penguins in Antarctica, not voters, especially voters of different nationalities.
The Arctic is only water, with the North Pole itself 4,200 meters under the surface.
But five countries are very close: Norway, Russia, the United States, Canada, and Denmark (via Greenland, which will become independent in the coming years).
This poses a real threat to the Eskimo and Inuit populations, as well as to polar bears.
The Not So United Nations
Syria’s Chemical Genie
Now Israel says that chemical weapons have been used by the Syrian regime.
Likewise, during China’s Cultural Revolution, the imposition of martial law prevented attempts by rival factions to seize nuclear facilities in Xinjiang and Qinghai.
In 1961, as a group of former French generals revolted in French Algeria, an atomic-bomb test in the Sahara went off without a hitch.
Take Guinea Conakry.
The case of neighbouring Guinea-Bissau, where a blood-bath has just taken place ahead of general elections, should serve as a warning.
It is not good news for Western human rights champions if China ends up training policemen in countries like Guinea.
ASPEN – Public-opinion polls in the United States indicate a close presidential election in November.
In part, this series of speeches was tactical.
The Obama Effect
LONDON – In the last two months, I have been in eight American cities – Boston, New York, Washington, Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle.
Phew!
First, if you have to travel from city to city in the United States, you would do yourself a favor if you could find a way of journeying by train.
American airlines are pretty awful.
Do American air travelers know just how bad the service that they get really is?
Los Angeles gets the Oscar, with Soviet-style queues through security.
The lakeside architecture of Chicago.
The sight of Puget Sound in Seattle (one of my favorite cities).
The view across San Francisco’s bay from Nob Hill.
Park Avenue in New York on a fine late spring morning.
They are all, to borrow from Frank Sinatra, “my kind of town.”
Much of the automobile industry is bust.
But there is another factor at work.
Down goes the economy and down goes the Labour government’s standing.
But what about the impact of politics on economics?
He is, as one American commentator calls him, The One.
Moreover, his wife is a star in her own formidable right.
I am a fan myself: a fan with two worries.
Obama is smart enough to understand this.
Barack Obama is a star.
But it needs one who continues to shine brightly for several years to come.
But this anticipation is also a problem for Obama, as it will be difficult – and in some instances impossible – for him to meet expectations.
The rest of the world was often unhappy with George W. Bush, for both the content and style of his foreign policy.
The Official Pursuit of Happiness
Beyond that, who knows?
In a democracy, at least, that should surely count for something.
For example, trade in Guangdong Province and Hong Kong in the first quarter of 2013 increased by 91.6% year on year.
For most of the twenty-first century, emerging markets’ rising importance –&#160;and, with it, a reordering of the global economy and international relations – has been conventional wisdom.
Why do so many Holocaust survivors sense emerging anti-Jewish threats before seeing them?
We listen to the survivors so that we survive.
So the struggle against anti-Semitism is a task for Jews and non-Jews alike.
Once Jewish religion was the target.
When Judaism did not surrender, Jews were expelled or killed.
Sometimes anti-Zionists claim that they are not against Jews but are "only" against the Jewish state.
But suppose someone said: "I am only against the existence of Great Britain, I am not anti-British!"
You would not believe them.
The One Percent Solution
That makes a total of $70 per family.
If recipients claimed to have been affected by the destruction of the Twin Towers, they received money for utilities and groceries as well.
New Yorkers, wealthy or not, living in lower Manhattan on September 11, 2001, were able to receive an average of $5,300 per family.
So far the money has not been forthcoming.
There are about 900 million people in the developed world, 600 million of them adults.
For example, the US consumes more than nine times as much oil as China on a per capita basis.
Of course, not all commodities are equal.
A New Greek Test for Europe
Greece has so far repaid almost none of the €282 billion ($372 billion) in loans that it has received since 2010.
But there is a twist.
The European Union would thus be transformed into a true federation, the United States of Europe.
That would be a triumph for the European project.
The Open Education Revolution
As the founders of two of the world’s largest open-source media platforms – Wikipedia and Connexions – we have both been accused of being dreamers.
Independently, we became infected with the idea of creating a Web platform that would enable anyone to contribute their knowledge to free and open learning resources.
Jimmy started with his popularly generated encyclopedia.
But imagine a world where textbooks and other learning materials are available to everyone for free over the Web and at low cost in print.
But imagine a world where textbooks are adapted to many learning styles and translated into myriad languages.
Such a world was just a dream a decade ago.
Open licenses make the materials legal to use and remix.
Technical innovations like XML and print-on-demand make delivering the output technically feasible and inexpensive.
Everyone has something to teach.
Everyone has something to learn.
The Operating System that Stole Christmas
Before asking for a new Windows PC this holiday season, remember the old adage: “Be careful about what you wish for.”
Consider Vista, yet another “great” new operating system that Microsoft rolled out this year, together with Office 2007.
The first person at my company to use Vista was our Executive Vice-President.
Vista and Office 2007 came with his new Dell computer by default.
Moreover, his coworkers couldn’t read the Microsoft Word files that he sent them in the new “.docx” format.
Obviously, Microsoft owns its old software and can decide at what price to sell it – or whether to sell it at all.
If everyone woke up tomorrow expecting that the world would shift to Apple within a year, sales of Windows would plummet.
But that is not our world.
Whenever Microsoft rolls out a new operating system, the question is not whether you should switch, but when.
Of course, creating new software is costly.
So why should Microsoft bother?
For Microsoft, the problem is that the marginal cost of software is zero.
When that happens, I hope the antitrust authorities will consider a remedy that Ian Ayres, Hal Varian, and I devised.
If Microsoft’s new software had to compete successfully at least against its old software, we would know the world was improving.
The Opportunity in Seoul
The Orange Velvet Revolution
Ukraine is undergoing a true liberal revolution, akin to the great European liberal revolutions of 1848, and reminiscent of Prague’s Velvet revolution of 1989.
This is a truly bourgeois revolution.
Ukraine needs early parliamentary elections, but that is constitutionally difficult to accomplish.
The Russian threat lingers, whereas the West is more likely than not to be too passive.
The Origin of Life
Primitive organisms arose from nonliving matter in what were probably hot, sulfurous, metal-laden, volcanic waters.
The first is  chemistry , the essence of life.
Something similar happened in the origin of life, but along pathways, by the action of catalysts, and with sources of energy that remain to be identified.
Enormous research efforts have already been devoted to this problem.
This function, fulfilled mostly by DNA today, was probably first carried out by RNA, a close relative of DNA. 
In the beginning, replication concerned only RNA molecules.
But the United States alone cannot bring peace to the region.
Understanding "the other" will pose the 21 st century's greatest social challenge.
Advocates of this view claim that cultural variation is but the surface play of appearances.
Here the charge of relativism arises.
The difference will be that different questions will be asked, different issues raised, and different features will stand out as remarkable.
In short, some will be more "right" and come closer to truth than others.
The Other Central Europe
In its place, an ugly new form of national populism is emerging across the plain that extends between Bavaria and the Danube.
Today, it appears that the Potsdam declarations of 1945, which sanctioned the mass eviction of German populations, are the new enemy.
After 1945, Western Europe undertook painful debates about history, and these helped bring about Franco-German reconciliation.
The Other Europe’s 1968
Unlike in the West, intergenerational conflict played a minor role in the Polish 1968.
Students united to support two of their colleagues who had been expelled for their protests at the National Theater.
One slogan was “No bread without freedom.”
The Other Half of the Peace Process
The difference now is that, unlike the Madrid Conference after the 1991 American-led Gulf War, the current effort is coming after a perceived American defeat in Iraq.
The Other Palestinian Revolution
Abbas will now bask in the glow of having been elected.
Is Palestinian society so different from other Arab societies?
Not really.
If the Palestinians, under Israeli occupation, can choose their own leaders, why can't the same happen in Cairo or Damascus, in Ryadh or Algiers?
The Other Poland
The Polish Solidarity revolution followed an unusual course.
A list of names found in the reports of the Security Services was to be prepared and made public.
Never since the fall of communism had a Catholic Cardinal used such words of condemnation.
The Other Switzerland
I was born on Swiss soil, but that did not give me the right to a Swiss passport.
I have a framed copy of the Act of Parliament by Dail Eireann that was needed.
The canton of Neuchatel (one of the 26 mini-states that comprise the Swiss confederation) lies alongside the French border.
In the case of Neuchatel, this includes the canton as well as the picturesque lakeside city.
The fact that Facchinetti himself is the lynchpin of the canton’s open-minded views may be seen as a weakness, but it is also its strength.
Tolerance has a face – the neat smiling figure of this son of Italian immigrants, who is easily accessible to the canton’s citizens.
Partly as a result of his efforts, Neuchatel was one of the four cantons in Switzerland to vote against the ban on new minarets.
No two countries, regions, or cities are the same.
And a nearly identical, invariably lethal disease, kuru, had ravaged the aboriginal people in Papua New Guinea throughout the twentieth century.
Both kuru and scrapie are infectious.
Kuru was transmitted through cannibalistic rituals that were commonplace in Papua New Guinea until the 1950’s.
The resulting epizootic (animal epidemic) affected more than 280,000 cows.
At its peak in 1992, mad cow disease was claiming nearly 1,000 head of cattle weekly.
But British beef was not safe.
But these were not the prions of classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Since then, “new variant” Creutzfeltdt-Jakob disease has claimed roughly 300 lives.
Sensitive detection of pathogens, such as HIV, typically relies on the presence of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA), which are absent in prions.
Using recently developed “zinc finger nuclease” technology, any given gene can be removed from an animal’s DNA.
In fact, prion-free sheep and cows have already been created.
The Outsourcing Bogeyman
Consider just two.
I tried this with a Dell computer and gave up after repeated attempts.
I was so desperate that I asked Michael Dell, whom I met at the World Economic Forum in Davos, for a replacement.
So Dell has now given up relying on call centers.
Thus, foreign radiologists need US certification before they are allowed to read the x-rays sent from the US.
Until recently, only two foreign firms qualified.
Senator Barbara Boxer railed continually against Carly Fiorina, a former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, that she had exported 35,000 jobs.
But, if I had not, HP would have become uncompetitive in fiercely competitive markets, and I would have lost 100,000 jobs.”
But if Indians can make the call for $0.25, the nursing home might well sign on.
In short, everyone wins from outsourcing of services.
The threat comes from an unlikely source: organized crime.
The reason is simple.
However, new reports show a thinning of the ozone layer over the Arctic, and last year’s Antarctic ozone hole was as large and deep as ever.
Is the volume of illicit CFC trading so large that it is now a factor of real importance?
In most cases, the forbidden CFC’s have been labeled as permitted HFC’s (hydrogenfluorocarbons), but labels like “spray paint” and “lubricants” also have been used. 
Ships and airplanes have been used for transport in this black-market trade.
One such line, which is presumed to be significant, goes from Europe (Spain) via Singapore or Dubai, through India to Nepal or Bangladesh and back again to the market in India.
One is that industrial and developing countries march at different speeds when it comes to phasing out CFC’s.
This means that what is banned in one country is permitted elsewhere.
Another problem is that there are no restrictions on the sale of old equipment that runs only on the banned substances.
The consequences for the Middle East and beyond could be deadly.
With some 40% of the population uncommitted to either camp, the competition between the two forces is far from resolution.
The US never occupied Afghanistan, but Israel occupies Palestinian land.
The Palin Charade
Working-class white women in America have had their talents exploited and undervalued for as long as the nation has functioned.
Their ceiling is made of concrete, and it is pitched far lower over their talents and their mobility.
Race, too, is a factor.
When you’ve been making the coffee forever, it’s nice to imagine leading the free world.
It’s also that she believes that God set her legislative agenda in Alaska, and that she has failed to venture much beyond the Discovery Channel when it comes to foreign travel.
LONDON – Senator John McCain is a genuine American hero.
After all, this is exactly how he had behaved as a senator.
Whatever else you say about the governor’s views, no one could call the choice of the “hockey mom” from Alaska a bold bid for consensus.
It is impossible to imagine her surviving a primary campaign.
But no one seems disposed to contemplate her heroic lack of qualifications to sit a heartbeat away from the Oval Office.
He would be president, not the Alaskan.
I would get back to the central issues.
The Pandemic That Wasn’t
But the outbreak appears to have ended less like the rogue wild boar that WHO bureaucrats predicted and more like a roasted pork tenderloin with apples and sage.
For all these reasons, the declaration of a pandemic must not be a prediction but rather a kind of real-time snapshot.
We had looked out across what Christians call the Holy Land from the Jordanian hills.
Or at least it was as true.
This was an identity clash that had nothing to do with the essential messages of Christianity.
The Belfast peace agreement of 1998 has secured more than 10 years of peace.
We talked the terrorist IRA and their political wing into the political process and the sharing of power.
But the outcome has been the return of normality to the one and a half million people of Northern Ireland.
In a way, it underlines the importance of what has been achieved in Northern Ireland.
Paracetamol use both in the first year of life and in children aged 6-7 was also associated with an increased risk of symptoms of rhinitis and eczema.
Identifying the potential mechanisms that might underlie the association between paracetamol and asthma (and other allergic disorders) was not a part of this study.
The Paranoid Style in Russian Politics
The Party is Over
MUNICH – With the United States teetering into recession, the global economic boom has ended.
In both western and eastern Europe, the index sank more than in Asia or Latin America.
In the US, the WES indicator is now below the level of September 11, 2001 and so is the Michigan index of consumer confidence.
No longer.
More promising is the $150 billion tax cut that the US Congress recently enacted.
But, whatever happens, the party is over.
The Past in China\u0027s Present
No country's history can be written in black and white.
Such a process has now started in Taiwan.
The Past is Now
Seventy years ago, it was one of the world's richest countries.
Despite that, until recently, literacy levels were high by Latin American standards and there was a broad middle class.
Democracy was restored in 1983, but decades of economic mismanagement began catching up to the country with a vengeance.
Then they lost confidence in the banking system and rushed to take their money out.
The end result was De la Rua's forced resignation and today's economic chaos.
I am not so sure.
It will not be easy.
The PC Turns 25
In August 1981, IBM introduced the 5150 personal computer.
No good deed goes unpunished: by making the PC, IBM practically destroyed itself as a company.
The PC seemed at first to promise a restoration of the balance in favor of the individual.
It did not seem to produce many efficiency gains, despite enormous investments in information technology.
Only with inter-connection in the 1990’s, above all through the Internet, did the PC realize its potential.
Some observers believe that this interconnectivity has now, after a quarter-century, made the PC obsolete.
Things are not turning out as planned.
If these components were boxed and sold as a parlor game, those playing it would not find creating Middle East peace especially challenging.
When nothing is moving in the right direction, the most appropriate step might be to press the pause button.
Here, everyone needs to tread with care.
The People Versus Putin
Yet that idea is now under threat because of the successor we chose.
People are beginning to realize this.
Putin, too, also seems to suspect his regime’s impotence.
The People versus the Police
There were 170 arrests.
Protesters ideally should dedicate themselves to disciplined, nonviolent disruption in this spirit – especially disruption of traffic.
In every country, protesters should field an army of attorneys.
Provocateurs, too, need to be photographed and logged, which is why it is important not to cover one’s face while protesting.
A leader does not have to sit atop a hierarchy: a leader can be a simple representative.
In lower Manhattan’s Zuccotti Park, for example, there is a library and a kitchen; food is donated; kids are invited to sleep over; and teach-ins are organized.
Musicians should bring instruments, and the atmosphere should be joyful and positive.
Official data suggest that the US economy entered into a recession in the first quarter of this year.
Indeed, three quarters of Canada’s exports go to the US, while foreign demand accounts for a quarter of its GDP.
But which is the right template?
So 1907 became a comforting mantra in times of financial stress: a crisis cannot happen as long as the central bank understands the problem of liquidity.
This nationalist-minded rhetoric has returned in the financial crisis of 2007.
We are not living in 1907, when the gold standard limited the ability of central banks to supply additional liquidity.
Today, the responses to the 1907 and 1931 crises would only make matters worse.
If today’s credit crunch has historical parallels, they are closer to nineteenth-century “normal crises” like 1837, 1847, or 1857.
Left to our own devices, we have proven ourselves tragically incapable of breaking the genetic code of our dispute.
The third surprise, however, may be the most interesting.
A normal US economy has a short-term nominal interest rate of 4%.
But, in July 2011, the ten-year US Treasury bond rate crashed to 2%, and it was below 1.5% at the start of June.
Big Banks’ Tall Tales
While the debate over megabanks sometimes sounds technical, in fact it is quite simple.
I asked all of them the same question: When will we have a binding framework for cross-border resolution?
Translation: Orderly resolution of global megabanks is an illusion.
What the two narratives about financial reform have in common is that neither has a happy ending.
The Phelps Factor
On December 10, Edmund Phelps, my colleague at Columbia University, received the Nobel Prize in economics for 2006.
The award was long overdue.
But the NAIRU is not immutable.
We were right.
Even for a rich country, that is a lot of money.
It could even pay for a substantial share of the cost for a war like that in Iraq!
The Philippines’ Sanctuaries of Terror
New cohorts will pose a danger for years to come.
Mindanao is not Cambodia or Lebanon, but the essential dilemma is the same.
State failure in the southern Philippines now places the entire region at risk.
It would fail in Mindanao, too.
Instead, surgical military strikes based on an expanded intelligence effort should complement the peace process, prying extremists away from the MILF mainstream.
Prompt, substantial infusions of post-conflict aid will be indispensable ingredients for peace.
Only then will they lose their vested interest in an insurgency that has no end.
The first was the hacking of a climate-change research center in England.
Here it should be understood that the IPCC issues thousands of pages of text.
The Pig, the Wolf, and the Dragon
Indeed, the original electoral script was a one-act, one-star play.
Tang was not.
The tycoons fear that Leung’s deeply old-fashioned communist values would hurt their oligopolies.
The press calls him the “petty greedy CE.”
Sir Donald enjoys riding on their private jets and luxury yachts while on personal holidays abroad.
The Pillars of Darwinism
Darwin, however, did not invent the idea of descent with modification.
Natural selection results whenever the differences between individuals affect the number of offspring they produce.
We need to know how organisms develop and reproduce, what is inherited and how it is inherited, and how heritable variations are generated. 
Until recently, biologists’ view of these processes has been very gene-centered, as exemplified by Richard Dawkins’ idea of the “selfish gene.”
Inheritance and reproduction have been seen in terms of DNA and its replication, and variation in terms of random changes in DNA sequences.
In a sense, we have to go back to Darwin’s original, pluralistic convictions.
And there lies the problem.
Keeping Somalia’s sea-borne supply line open is imperative.
Estimates put their number at around 1,200.
The Canadian naval mission ends in late October, and no country has stepped forward to replace it.
Without naval escorts, food aid will not get to Somalia.
Somalia’s political future is uncertain at best.
The next is to develop a comprehensive strategy, in conjunction with the UN Security Council, to eliminate piracy in Somali waters.
The Placebo Myth
But all is not well in such countries.
Stopping criminal activity is a legitimate government concern.
Indeed, it is a firmly established legal principle that crime should be addressed by a determination of individual guilt before a court of law.
But no ethnic group monopolizes such pathologies, and all people should be equal before the law.
Roma want to and can integrate if they are given the opportunity, as my foundation’s programs have shown.
Primary responsibility for safeguarding the rights and well-being of all citizens lies with EU member states.
Money could be issued because governments had the power to define the unit of account in which taxes should be paid.
This tradition went back well before paper, or fiat, currencies.
After World War II, the liberal politicians most committed to European federalism saw this point clearly.
The separatists were politically radical – on the left in Saxony, and on the far right in Bavaria and the Rhineland.
They were supported by the twentieth century’s two most influential economists, Friedrich von Hayek and John Maynard Keynes.
That view is now seriously challenged.
This description of stock markets in emerging countries is not wrong, just biased, because the same description applies to stock markets in advanced countries.
Consider the United States stock market, by far the world's largest.
This is very strong stuff.
America’s General Electric was one of the pioneers here.
GE has saved $340 million annually since shifting some of its back-office work to India.
Taking all costs into account, a call center in Kansas City costs more than three times as much as one in Mumbai.
India has been a major and growing outsourcing location for Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, British Airways, and other major corporations.
But it its hardly alone.
Wrong.
On the Ku Klux Klan’s Web sites, economics now vies for space with race hatred.
The Politics of Cosmic Catastrophe
As far as can be determined, that object detonated on June 30, 1908, with the power of a nuclear weapon, felling 80 million trees over a 2,000-square-kilometer area. 
According to NASA, if Apophis hit the Earth, it could release more than 100,000 times the energy of the Tunguska event.
Scientists have proposed various ways to deflect an asteroid away from the Earth.
Attaching “solar sails” to the asteroid could cause the Sun’s particles to steer it along a different course.
It also could be amended, or the states “attacking” the asteroid could withdraw from the agreement by giving one year’s notice.
Since an asteroid collision could, like global climate change, affect all of humanity, should not everyone have some say in the decision?
Are they precluded from acting without unanimity?
Does extreme poverty breed violence and ultimately revolution?
Opportunities exist, but they cannot be seized or realized.
The heavy hand of nomenklatura rule was gone, and the vision of a new life like that in the open societies of the West seemed real.
The route to prosperity and freedom was not straightforward. On the contrary, it led through a valley of tears.
Here, too, the phenomenon was not new.
WARSAW: We in Poland have had a hectic political year.
Last autumn we had presidential elections; this autumn we will have parliamentary elections.
During the presidential elections Mr. Andrzej Olechowski ran as an independent candidate.
Mr. Olechowski is well known in Polish politics, for he was once a minister of finance and later a minister of foreign affairs.
So, it seems that democracy should not only provide personal satisfaction for politicians but for the people, too.
Pleasure is here understood as John Stuart Mill understood it.
So, if assessed from a neutral standpoint, social democracy is clearly the better choice for all.
The Politics of Psychiatry
The reasons for this stem from the nature of mental disorders themselves.
Physical symptoms are almost never positively valued, but some symptoms of mental disorders typically are.
Consider a bit of science fiction.
Let us say that, at some point in the future, neurobiology will explain not only major mental disorders, but also criminality.
The Politics of Revolutionary Surprise
Just before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, a CIA report characterized the Iranian monarchy as an “island of stability.”
A month before the Russian Revolution of February 1917, Lenin predicted that his country’s great explosion lay in the distant future.
The aftermath of an unanticipated revolution will itself present surprises.
The Politics of Self-Destruction in Peru
An arch of blue (Democratic) states in the East, North, and West spans a huge red (Republican) area in the middle and the South.
Religion plays a part in them, including the literal truth of the bible when it comes to the story of the creation.
Gays and other “modern” practices are rejected as self-indulgent.
One answer is that as an American phenomenon, the politics of values may command a majority now, but it is by no means general.
The German debate is still largely a policy debate.
Robots on the Brain
And they can be upgraded periodically to integrate new features seamlessly.
What robots lack is the human brain’s executive capacity.
Technologies like MRI can help in surgical planning, resection control, and quality assurance.
Yet in the end it did not matter.
China is not Tunisia or Egypt, of course.
But this view is misleading, particularly in the current economic situation.
Securities based on those contracts ended up, in part, in the hands of financial institutions.
This affected all the producers, distributors, and retailers whose plans and contracts were based on now-obsolete expectations.
And so it goes.
Viewed from a matching perspective, there is no failure of “aggregate demand” – whatever that means.
The Poverty of Thinking About Poverty
As for biodiversity, the most important species threatened with extinction today is the human race.
For this reason, whatever fine, ringing pronouncement, do emerge from the Earth Summit, they are doomed to failure.
All these tattered arguments were replayed at the G-8 summit in Okinawa last week.
If child labour is wrong, it is always wrong.
Yet, the weaknesses of such high-mindedness (assuming it is high-minded) are easily exposed.
Most people, however, accept that wars can occasionally be justified as a lesser evil.
But the effects of unemployment on a person’s self-esteem are less easily measured.
The first problem is that European NATO consists of 16 separate countries, 16 separate defense budgets, and 16 separate defense forces.
By April, all had been sentenced to 14-27 years in prison.
They witness.
They write.
So, one-by-one, many left.
But Rivero stayed.
He stayed, calling himself an "inixile."
In mid-September the pressure continued to build.
Rivero must still take pleasure in the poem by Nestor Leliebre Camue, a native of Santiago de Cuba.
"Don't plunge into the sea
for the love of God.
A fascinating brightness
Is rising from the land."
"Now, like T.S. Eliot, I can say, 'April is the cruelest month.'
April 4 is a bad day for me.
On April 4, my mother gave me 18 knocks on the head for joining the Young Pioneers (the communist youth organization) without her permission.
This last April 4, they gave me 18 years for writing without permission.
The first time I was a child, this second I'm an old man.
To believe otherwise is to commit the “fallacy of composition.”
The economist Paul Krugman calls this the “confidence fairy.”
Moreover, unlike during Ahmadinejad’s first term, non-state media now publicly criticize his economic and political agenda.
The Press versus Privacy
But Article 8 is balanced by Article 10, which guarantees “free expression of opinion.”
But one can have too much press freedom.
This implies that had there been a Nazi theme, it could have been legitimate to publish it, given Mosley’s position as FIA president.
By contrast, in Britain it is left to judges to decide what the “right to privacy” means.
Thus, a pop star’s consumption of illegal drugs may be reported, but not his or her sexual habits (if they are legal).
The media might become a bit drearier, but public life would be far healthier.
The Price of 9/11
Today, America is focused on unemployment and the deficit.
The Price of Clarity
But was Swift right to see knavery as the main motive for unintelligibility?
Obviously, it is a very powerful motive, in politics no less than in finance.
There has never been a shortage of snake-oil merchants: Donizetti wrote an opera, L’Elisir D’Amore, about one of them advertising a love potion in a nonsensical patter.
Consider the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s current civil suit against Goldman Sachs.
Was his intention to deceive?
As important is a straightforward decline in literacy.
This quality is much in evidence in a recent IMF report:
So let us translate that IMF passage into transparent English:
Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England estimates that the present value of the corresponding losses in future output could well reach 100% of world GDP.
The Price of Inaction
Now, I am not so certain.
Japan and Britain began their New Deals in 1931.
Germany and the US began theirs in 1933.
France waited until 1936.
There is an 80% chance that waiting until 2010 and seeing what policies look appropriate then would not be disastrous.
But that means that there is a 20% chance that it would be.
This is one of the reasons that America has the highest level of inequality of any of the advanced countries –&nbsp;and its gap with the rest has been widening.
All of the benefits of growth have gone to the top.
But growing inequality is not inevitable.
This leads to underinvestment in infrastructure, education, and technology, impeding the engines of growth.
SANTIAGO – In 1986, opposition journalist José Carrasco Tapia was dragged from his home in Santiago, Chile, by one of General Augusto Pinochet’s death squads.
Even more widespread than indirect repression is the corrupting pressure of government money.
A third of the world’s mammal species and more than a quarter of all known reptiles and bird species can be found there.
But this abundance is under threat.
As a result, more than 10,000 species are threatened with extinction – two-thirds of all endangered species on the planet.
A fern deep in the forest could, for example, one day prove helpful in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
This idea became very popular in the 1990’s.
Forests contain huge amounts of carbon.
Recent market transactions on the European Climate Exchange place the value of carbon somewhere between $10 and $100 per ton.
Sorting out the benefits is one thing.
For a landowner, the value of cleared land works out to $300 per hectare on average.
F OR PUBLICATION FEBRUARY 22, NOT BEFORE
In that regard, this morning NATO leaders will welcome their first meeting with President Yushchenko.
The Privatization of War
After all, the tragedy of September 11 th happened within the US, so the sense of immediacy was greater and longer lasting there.
Two sets of trends are at work.
The Internet makes it virtually free.
Organization also changed.
Every large group of humans contains members who deviate from the norm.
Some are bent on destruction.
In the l980s, Sikh extremists bombed an Air India flight, killing 325 people.
Destroying New York's Twin Towers cost several thousand lives.
Business as usual will not be enough.
Policymakers and philanthropists need access to regularly updated information on how to use limited funds effectively.
More money and attention was soon devoted to HIV prevention and treatment.
Debate and discussion is encouraged by ensuring that three papers are written for each topic, so that a range of expert opinions is available.
But the project goes a step further.
But are the most prominent problems necessarily those that we should address immediately?
We find out in May.
The Problem with “China Bashing”
Moreover, the cure can be worse than the disease.
Such measures are, of course, an unfortunate detour.
To begin understand the differences between the US and Europe, look at the quality of the labor force.
Where the gap with the US is most stunning is found in something called "total factor productivity."
The first is related to organization.
This exposes the second weakness: the ability to innovate.
Everything flows.
Germany was united.
The United States elected a black man president.
The proportion of people living below the World Bank’s poverty line of $1.25 a day shrank from 52% in 1981 to only 25% in 2005.
In the US and Germany, 13% of the population is foreign born, as are 8% of France inhabitants and 10% of Britain’s.
The Promise of Euro-Atlantic Missile Defense
Iran is a case in point.
In February 2009, Iran introduced the SAFIR 2 space launch vehicle.
We are not starting from scratch.
NATO itself is developing protections for our deployed troops.
It needs to be built.
The Hydrogen Solution
By now, many have heard about plans by big carmakers – including Honda, Toyota, and Hyundai – to launch hydrogen fuel-cell cars commercially around 2015.
Daimler, Ford, and Nissan plan to launch such cars around 2017.
Japan and Korea have announced similar plans.
Canada’s Hydrogenics is providing the electrolyzer and a fuel cell.
And the world’s first renewable energy/hydrogen hybrid power plant, producing both electricity and hydrogen as car fuel, started production in the fall of 2011.
This was no mere gesture.
Yet that did not happen. 
The TAL set a rigorous schedule for the Assembly to complete an initial constitutional draft, and the Assembly essentially abided by those limits.
The deadline extension that it passed was in keeping with both the spirit and the letter of the TAL.
Regardless of who wins the elections, there will be temptations to tinker with the constitutional text.
That has been the missing ingredient, not only in Iraq, but also in other countries ruled by despots.
The Prophet and the Commissars
But will he be a force in keeping with the liberating vistas of his greatest works?
Solzhenitsyn was used in this way twice.
For 1,000 years, Russia has belonged to such a category.ampquot;
In choosing to allow One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich to be published, Khrushchev knew that he was undermining the entire Soviet era up to that point.
The Protocols of Rupert Murdoch
(What could be less conservative than that?)
Stranger still is his attack on, of all people, US President Woodrow Wilson.
Now a new epicenter for the Wilson-Hitler-Obama axis has been identified in the person of George Soros.
While horror-film music plays and clips of history’s disasters are shown on the screen, a voice intones, “Eighty years ago, George Soros was born.
Beck doesn’t say so, of course, but what Soros has actually done is give support through his Open Society foundations to pro-democracy movements in many countries.
Glenn Beck’s assault on Soros – and the unmistakable stench of its atrocious antecedents – suggests what sort of revolution they may have in mind.
The best answer that I have heard comes from Axel Weber, the former president of Germany’s Bundesbank and an astute political observer.
If the problem has not been experienced before, the public is not convinced of the potential costs of inaction.
A classic example was Winston Churchill’s warnings against Adolf Hitler’s ambitions.
The Nazis’ dismembering of Czechoslovakia in 1938 made the sincerity of Hitler’s ambitions all too clear.
Non-linear costs of inaction are most obvious in the financial sector.
Not a single state-owned company has an independent chairman.
As usual with such initiatives, implementation matters.
The Putin Parody
If Vick were never to play football again, he would suffer punishment well beyond that imposed by the court.
Vick has expressed remorse.
The answer might depend on the nature of the crime, the length of the sentence, and the proportion of it that remains to be served.
There he lived with a female companion and a staff to assist him.
After three years, he was released even from this form of detention.
(Medina was acquitted of murder.)
The vast majority of deaths discussed in the report did not actually result from global warming.
The technologies that can really make a difference quickly and at lower cost are scrubbers that clean smokestack emissions, catalytic converters that reduce tailpipe emissions, and many others.
Likewise, overcoming the burden of indoor air pollution will happen only when people can use kerosene, propane, and grid-based electricity.
But, for both indoor and outdoor air pollution, the opposite is more likely true: lower carbon emissions would mean more air pollution deaths.
To be sure, French and Dutch citizens did not respond to the question that they were supposed to answer.
Fourth, the EU’s aspiration for a common foreign and security policy must be addressed.
The threats facing the world today are supranational, so counteracting them must be supranational, too.
The Racism of the Welfare State
Today the only US city that uses proportional representation is the leftist bastion of Cambridge Massachusetts.
It is lacking in the racially mixed Southeast and Southwest.
SYDNEY – Burma, once the richest country in Southeast Asia, today is mired in deep poverty.
If all goes well, new gas fields recently discovered in the Bay of Bengal will provide even more gas for China’s Yunnan Province.
To get the gas into Yunnan, a much longer pipeline – running the length of Burma – must be built.
The device is simple.
According to the informal exchange rate, the kyat’s worth is currently about 1,000 to one against the dollar.
There are now an estimated 600,000 to one million internal refugees.
It has ratified the UN Convention to Eliminate Discrimination Against Women and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The Re-Birth of Japanese Democracy
The center-left Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) took more than 300 of 480 seats in the lower house.
Indeed, it has often been said, by Japanese as well as foreign commentators, that a de facto one-party state suits the Japanese.
But one-party rule breeds complacency, corruption, and political sclerosis.
The Re-Birth of Utopia
In France, this intensity is particularly visible within Socialist ranks.
Should the state confine itself to creating an economic environment favorable to private enterprise?
Leung’s son, for example, is reportedly a student at Winchester College, one of the UK’s most exclusive boarding schools.
In this country, the real blockade, the one that affects the daily life of the people, is the internal governing system.
Indeed, parents cannot really influence how schools shape their children.
The Real Che Guevara
Steven Soderbergh’s new film about Che Guevara, however, does that, and more.
The same goes for the legendary Che.
No communist leader, indeed, ever held humanist values.
Karl Marx certainly was not one.
Blood needed to be shed if a better world was to be baptized.
Five centuries ago, Che probably would have been one of those priest/soldiers exterminating Latin America’s natives in the name of God.
By doing so, it opened the way to military dictatorship.
Perhaps if Soderbergh’s two-part Che epic succeeds at the box office, his financial backers will want to film a more truthful sequel.
I was invited to address this issue at a recent conference in Santa Barbara, California.
This is a fantasy.
This means that over the longer term, everyone will be competing for a piece of a pie that is smaller than it would have been without energy rationing.
But only up to a point.
Weak governments grow weaker by the day.
Emerging markets are inherently fragile markets.
The Real Long March
I was raised on it.
The myth can be stated succinctly.
The fledgling Communist Party and its three Red Armies were driven out of their bases in the South in the early 1930’s by Chiang Kaishek’s Nationalist government.
Pursued and harried by their enemies, they crossed high mountains, turbulent rivers, and impassable grassland, with Mao steering the course from victory to victory.
He had no choice: they had arrested his father and would not release him until Huang agreed.
Many did run away.
Six weeks into the March, Mao’s First Army was reduced from 86,000 to 30,000 troops.
“When you investigate historical facts, you should respect the truth. How you present it is a different matter.”
So the legend lives on.
There was only a skirmish over the Dadu River.
As a reward, he was later made a minister in the Communist government.
When they converged in north China in October 1936, it was hailed as the end of the March.
It could barely support its own population, let alone the Red Armies.
Soldiers had no clothes to protect them from freezing cold.
But the kidnapping of Chiang Kaishek by the general he had appointed to wipe out the Communists saved them.
The Long March was over.
It was the Red Army’s biggest defeat.
Yet it is missing from official history.
America's government budget deficit now stands at $455 billion, 4.1% of GDP.
No generation should be forced to accept unnecessary economic risks imposed by another generation.
Today, even formerly bankrupt governments from Korea to Russia to Mexico are awash in dollars.
Otherwise, they will pull up stakes, and the Fund (and its sister organization, the World Bank) will have a debt crisis of its own.
It doesn’t have to be this way.
Perhaps the IMF’s bedside manners would improve, perhaps not.
Today, genetics is the leading source of scientific promise.
The Reality of Virtual Power
That is the argument of my new book, The Future of Power.
Which resources will produce power?
The speed of Internet time means that all governments will have less control over their agendas.
Vladimir Putin’s Potemkin Love Life
MOSCOW – From Russia with love?
(He has two grown daughters, twins, with Lyudmila.)
Why make such a public and staged announcement?
Gorbachev’s wife, Raisa, stunned the nation not only by appearing in public, but by being fashionable and expressing opinions of her own.
How exactly is a recession defined?
America had a brief, sharp recession in 1980, followed by a long and severe one in 1981/1982.
These are not rare occurrences.
Around the same time, Germany had this type of double dip and the UK a quadruple dip.
And similar episodes have been common in many other countries.
The Red and the Blue
America remains closely divided into red states (Republican) and blue states (Democrat).
If 100,000 votes changed in the red state of Ohio, John Kerry would be the president (albeit with a minority of the popular vote).
But this should be seen in historical perspective.
The election map of red and blue states has given rise to Internet jokes and cartoons about the two blue coasts seceding from the red center of the country.
Reform of Germany’s generous social system has claimed the front pages for German papers for more than ten years.
In many cases, refugees built their own new homes.
Within a few years, the refugees were absorbed into the economy and society of the southern, Greek Cypriot sector of the island.
This is also one of the reasons few people have ever heard about the Greek Cypriot refugees.
The Regional Route to Global Free Trade
Even smaller ongoing negotiations, like those with Malaysia and Vietnam, offer some opportunity.
Most important, however, are the recently launched EU-Japan free trade talks.
Abe’s determined pursuit of the first two prongs has been well documented.
Indeed, the OECD ranks Japan last among member states in terms of regulatory restrictiveness with respect to inward foreign direct investment.
For Europe, which is seeking to expand its footprint in Asia, a strong link with a reformed Japanese economy would be a boon.
We need to ask ourselves if this should, in fact, be our first priority.
We could do all good things.
On the other hand, the experts rated immediate responses to climate change at the bottom of the world’s priorities.
This does not mean losing sight of the need to tackle climate change.
The RMB appreciated by 18.6% in real effective terms, and by 16% in dollar terms, from June 2005 to August 2008.
Yet, from 2006 to 2008, China’s annual exports grew 23.4%, outpacing import growth of 19.7%.
For China’s, the income effect of global demand is significantly larger than the price effect of the exchange rate.
Probably not.
As a result, balance-of-payments equilibrium would be reached at a certain exchange-rate level, but a current-account surplus (albeit smaller) would still exist.
The French are ready for a woman, but perhaps not this one.
But Royal has so far failed to rally her camp behind her.
So far, Royal has failed to play that role.
The Resistible Rise of Hindu Fascism
One night a year ago, a friend called me.
What Hindu scripture preaches this?
They worship at the same altar, apostles of the same murderous god, whoever he is.
But once Muslims are "shown their place," will milk and Coca-Cola flow across the land?
Those who speak English?
Those with thick lips?
Luckily, we don't yet have a Hitler.
In 1984, following Indira Gandhi's assassination, the ruling Congress Party presided over the massacre of 3,000 Sikhs.
For years it has injected a slow-release poison into society.
Everything flirts with it--parliament, the press, the police, and the administration.
Not of something they achieved, but of something they happen to be. Or, more accurately, something they happen not to be.
Unfortunately, no quick fix exists.
The Resource Curse Revisited
A similar pattern holds true in Sierra Leone and Botswana.
The result of this wealth grab is often war.
So abundant natural wealth often creates rich countries with poor people.
No wonder that they are demanding that the small group of those who benefit from the country's wealth start to share it.
Some countries, notably Nigeria, are trying to implement these lessons.
Western governments can help with common-sense reforms.
ABU DHABI – Sovereignty is not a license to kill.
Will they be enough to stop the killing?
That poses a huge risk of hostage-taking or other reprisals against any intervening country’s nationals still in Libya.
The global response to the horrors in Kenya in 2008 was a spectacular contrast to the indifference that greeted the butchery in Rwanda.
That has proved harder, as experiences in Darfur, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sri Lanka have demonstrated.
For all that it has done so far, the ball remains in the Security Council’s court.
The Cooperation Crisis
They are indigenous – and they are asking the West for help.
Likewise, China can injure Taiwan in ways that Taiwan cannot reciprocate.
Suppose a New Yorker buys shares in the Mumbai stock market.
What can be done about the erosion of global democracy and accountability?
Decisions taken behind opaque walls are more likely to be diverted to their interests. Take the WTO.
There were three reasons, all of which vanished by the end of WWII.
They wanted hard money above everything.
Third, knowledge about the economy was in its adolescence.
With the exception of the United States’ free-silver movement, it was not the subject of general political and public intellectual discussion.
All three of these factors vanished between the world wars.
And the working classes all have the vote.
Today, the flow of economy-wide spending is low.
That is entirely standard.
It has no choice: the seven-year notes are the shortest-duration Treasury bonds that now pay interest.
Still, here we are.
The Return of 1948
TEL AVIV – The forthcoming United Nation’s conference commemorating the 60th anniversary of UNRWA (The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees) could not come at a better moment.
In Zionism, the Jewish community in Palestine was the focus of decision making, with the Jewish Diaspora a strategic back-up.
It looks as if now the roles have been inversed.
It will, and it should.
The Return of Franco-German Leadership
Are there alternatives to Franco-German leadership of the European Union?
After all, France and Germany are closer to each other on many key topics than they have been for a long time.
With the return of France to NATO’s integrated military structure, the two countries are on the same “Atlantic” wavelength for the first time since 1966.
France and Germany cannot move Europe alone, but Europe without them cannot move at all.
Bretton Woods III
The surplus has narrowed because investment has been ramped up even higher, to roughly 49% of GDP.
The Roman Empire ran a persistent trade deficit with India for centuries.
And 1870-1913, another period of rapid growth and globalization, was not characterized by balance; it was funded by the United Kingdom, acting as the world’s “bank.”
Clearly, periods of global growth are almost always characterized by symbiotic imbalances.
McKinsey is advising governments on how to do it right.
In fact, industrial policy never went out of fashion.
China is a case in point.
The government has played a crucial role in developing every significant new export that the country produces.
But when it comes to industrial policy, it is the United States that takes the cake.
Today the US federal government is the world’s biggest venture capitalist by far.
This requires a government that is “embedded” in the private sector, but not in bed with it.
Second, industrial policy needs to rely on both carrots and sticks.
A second difference between the two models lies in whether consumer or producer interests are privileged.
For liberals, consumers are king.
But they are anti-liberal; they accept democracy’s demand for the popular legitimacy, but reject its demand for constitutionalism (the separation of powers).
After 15 years of free-market policies, populists in Warsaw, Bratislava, and Budapest want to bring back the state.
The Return of Religion?
BUDAPEST – It’s a well-worn contrast: the United States is religious, Europe is secular.
Consider French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
On numerous occasions, he has argued that his country needs to rethink its traditional strict separation of state and religion, called laïcité .
The Spanish People’s Party tried hard to mobilize Catholics during the election campaign in March 2008.
In short, there is a pattern here.
What really explains these new public controversies surrounding religion is something else, something political: the dilemma in which right-wing and center-right European parties find themselves.
Theories of “red Toryism” might go some way in this direction, but it remains to be seen whether they will ever translate into practice.
The Return of the King in Nepal
The next year, parliament was dissolved and local elected bodies were disbanded.
Nepal’s 15-year experiment with democracy now seems over.
Nepal’s vibrant FM radio stations – once models for decentralized public-service broadcasting and community radio – have been prohibited from broadcasting current affairs.
Some FM stations have been locked down and are silent.
The BBC’s Nepalese service, which used to be relayed through a network of 12 FM stations all over the country, has been stopped.
Most young journalists, especially those in radio, have been shocked by the censorship.
They have a point.
The king has a window of opportunity to deliver on his promises.
The Return of the Radicals in Iran
Deng was rehabilitated the following year, and in the late 1970’s, after Mao’s death, Deng’s pragmatists seized control of the regime.
Even so, one-fifth of Russia’s exports comprise metals and chemicals that are sensitive to anti-dumping measures.
It is the only G-20 country outside of the WTO, which accounts for 96% of global trade.
The WTO also represents a choice of economic and political strategy.
We conducted a systematic review of published reports to identify the factors that cause unsuccessful TB treatment in Europe.
Patients who feel better after the initial treatment may also fail to complete therapy.
Interruption was also associated with homelessness, intravenous drug use, and alcohol dependence in Hamburg.
I also believe that there is a relationship between the need for therapy and the political choices that countries make.
The Revolt of China’s Twittering Classes
Yet few voices in mainland Chinese media are discussing Liu’s Nobel Prize.
But the social revolution brought by microblogging might be even more important than the communication revolution.
The Revolt of the Debtors
Nobody can know at this point whether Portugal or Italy might be the next stops on this road of resistance.
Papandreou’s decision to call a referendum in Greece could thus have marked the beginning of the endgame for the euro.
Here lies the conundrum.
Human nature – ego and/or arrogance – does the rest.
It is no surprise, then, that many people think of themselves as priceless.
Money there is an abstraction – “the abstraction of abstractions,” as Hegel put it – which helps explain why salaries are no longer rooted in reality.
But now these same institutions are deciding that they want to go their own way again.
This calls for more modesty and restraint in determining the highest salaries, not for moral reasons but for the sustainability of the system.
The Revolt of the Mullahs
Now they are despondent.
Some of these now call for passive resistance and civil disobedience.
That Khamenei is himself more of an ideologue makes that task doubly difficult for him.
Backers of a socialist model have gone the way of the Soviet Union.
Liberal democracy is essentially the last man standing in Iran.
The road from authoritarianism to democracy will not be smooth or short.
For free individuals – free citizens, free states – are the real protagonists of governance.
In individual states protection of the weak is attained by equal application of the rule of law.
Only the cooperation of free and equal nations can bring this about.
The State should not abandon its redistributive role; neither can the State surrender to the market its role in development.
It is the State’s undeniable obligation to guarantee the benefits of social security to all the inhabitants of a country.
The only fish that always swims with the current is a dead fish.
KYIV – From snowy Kyiv, I have watched the successful revolutions in Cairo and Tunis with joy and admiration.
The first of Ukraine’s lessons for Egyptian and Tunisian democrats is that elections do not a democracy make.
In Ukraine today, these are not abstract questions.
Those who engage in them must be seen as democracy’s enemies and treated as such.
So the more power is concentrated at the center, the more it becomes possible for anti-democratic forces to gain – or regain – control over a country.
But El Salvador, like Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Ecuador, is another story.
We will know soon.
If too we add El Salvador to this list, only Costa Rica and Panama to the south remain out of the loop, leaving Mexico to the north increasingly exposed.
Of course, the Central American nations do not wield huge influence in Mexico; if anything, it is the other way around.
They will read Funes’ victory as one more notch on the barrel of “the people’s” rifle and one more hair plucked from Uncle Sam’s beard.
The Revolution Will Not Be Memorialized
Forty years ago Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution.
Another 100,000 were driven from their homes.
Soon, ancient sites would be ruined.
In the official “Memorabilia of the Cultural Revolution in Guangxi,” many infants appear on the death list.
The author Zheng Yi reported that in Wuxuan County alone, more than 100 people were eaten, because devouring enemies was the only way to prove one’s love for Mao.
Livers, eyes, or brains were removed while victims were still alive.
A total of 63 people were killed at the prestigious Beijing University.
People who experienced it seal off the memory, for the pain, worse than a bullet to the heart, overwhelms souls.
Last month, I watched a TV show featuring Han Meilin, a famous painter.
In his closing remarks, he announced his words of wisdom to viewers: “Long live those who don’t care!”
The Revolutionary Conservative Pope
Twenty-five years ago, Poland's people were stunned by the choice of their compatriot, Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Cracow, as Pope.
What is the Pope's message for the postcommunist world he helped create?
Indeed, by his words and example, the Pope disrupts the world: it wants to live in wealth and comfort; he reminds us that we must also live in dignity.
It is good that John Paul II is among us.
A world where everything changes needs a guardian of what remains the same.
A preposterous claim?
Yet, I'll stick to my claim.
Why is this?
Large parts of the so-called developing world, especially in Asia, have made incredible strides away from absolute poverty.
The Richest Get Richer
What has fed these inflows?
The first era was not an unqualified success.
But the hope for a repetition of the late 19th-century experience has - so far - proved vain.
From Bill Clinton to Robert Redford, countless pundits blamed Sandy on climate change.
Yet it will reduce sea-level rise by just nine millimeters by 2100.
This would cause sea surges of up to 7.5 meters (about three meters higher than Sandy), putting Kennedy Airport under six meters of water.
But the demise of the left does not mean that the right has a coherent economic program.
For the victorious coalition of the Law and Justice (PiS) party and Civic Platform (PO) is torn between liberal (PO) and populist instincts (PiS).&nbsp;
Only if populism is put at the service of liberal reform will the government achieve lasting benefits.
Global warming is real.
Why did thousands die in Haiti during the recent hurricanes and not in Florida?
Because Haitians are poor.
Now is the time to get our priorities right.
Doing the best things first would be a great investment in the planet’s future.
Anchoring the Arab Awakening
After Riccio gave him a sedative and switched off the respirator, Welby said “thank you” three times to his wife, his friends, and his doctor.
Forty-five minutes later, he was dead.
At the time of writing, it is unclear whether Riccio will be charged with any offense.
At least one Italian politician has called for his arrest on a charge of homicide.
That description applies well to Welby’s decision.
This distinction is dubious.
But if these allegations are true, no one has told the Dutch.
Isn’t that a choice that everyone should have?
The declaration that we have developed regards equality as a “freestanding right.”
In other words, it exists as a separate right, and is not dependent on the violation of some other legal right, such as the right to education.
Predictably, the Arizona tragedy has elicited calls for policy changes.
The vast majority of severely mentally disordered individuals are not violent.
The question is whether American values favoring individual rights somehow facilitated the Arizona tragedy.
The US also needs more accessible mental-health services.
With such blatant signals, why didn’t others intervene?
Though his community college suspended the suspect for his threatening demeanor, it took no further action.
Such measures might have prevented the Arizona shootings.
The Right Way to Beat Chinese Inflation
WASHINGTON, DC – High inflation is threatening social stability in China, soaring from 3.3% in March 2007 to 8.3% in March 2008.
As a result, the People’s Bank of China has raised interest rates substantially and increased banks’ reserve requirements.
The risks are high.
This is because manufactured exports are typically more labor-intensive than investment projects.
The Right Way to Electric Cars
NEW YORK – Excitement about electric cars abounds nowadays, but consider the number of existing gasoline-powered cars: about 850 million.
A small operation in Finland, it is less a company than a role model for companies that the team hopes will spring up worldwide.
eCars- Now! hopes to foster an ecosystem of car service workers and parts makers similar to the ecosystem of open-software programmers and generic computer hardware.
“No one had done that before in Finland,” he recalls.
The Toyota Corolla was the first choice – hardly surprising since it is the leading car model in Finland (with 7% of the market).
In Italy, inventor Roberto Vezzi had a Smart-EV project along the same lines.
He has now joined the eCars – Now! movement, and his eSmart car will be upgraded with the open-source graphical user interface being developed for the eCorolla in Finland.
In Finland, at least, all you need from the government is a certificate of inspection, which costs about €100 ($135).
If you build it, others will come!
Georgia must be weaned from humanitarian aid as soon as the situation allows it.
The Rise and Fall of Meritocracy
Two central questions raised by Young remain topical today.
What about those who do not make it to university?
The new underclass is the other side of the meritocratic elite.
Like all elites before them, they become firmly established – and use all available means to keep it that way.
The Rise and Fall of Putinism
MOSCOW – How did “Putinism” – that distinctively Russian blend of authoritarian politics and dirigiste economics – happen?
But Russian citizens, especially younger ones, are beginning to realize what they have lost.
Not in China.
·        geographical position and environment;
·        territorial capacity, specifically coastline

BALTIMORE &#45;&#45; Tuberculosis, one of the most deadly infectious diseases, is back with a vengeance, especially in Africa.
But it was an outbreak of XDR-TB in HIV-infected people in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, that turned the global spotlight on issues of extensively drug-resistant organisms.
How did this localized outbreak of XDR-TB emerge?
An unfortunate consequence of treating MDR-TB with second-line drugs, however, is the inevitable emergence of further drug resistance.
If the same factors that produce MDR-TB remain in play, then MDR-TB becomes XDR-TB.
Japan has played a unique role in world history.
Unfortunately, Japan moved onto militaristic imperialism in the 1930’s, which eventually led to its surrender and occupation in 1945.
As one Japanese liberal commented to me, “this is our third response to globalization.
Japan, Australia, Germany, or Canada might be just such powers.
Moreover, they are non-nuclear powers with no permanent seats in the UN Security Council.
All are long time allies of the US.
There are many other potential mid-level democratic countries that should take part.
And enterprises in other countries are adopting a similar online business model.
An East Asian economic bloc forming around either China and/or Japan now seems plausible.
Thai protectionism remains high.
Indonesia and the Philippines are mired in political and economic instability.
Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, all very poor, have higher levels of protection.
China presents a different picture.
Singapore pioneered this approach.
Similar initiatives are afoot in Northeast Asia.
This is the right approach for those in China's leadership who wish to extract maximum benefits from the WTO to bolster domestic reform.
Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia are in the queue for WTO accession.
The WTO is at a crossroads.
Many of them--including China--are to be found in East Asia.
And, beyond childhood and adolescence, the need for specialized personal support only grew.
How can child-care providers be trusted?
But the element of personal dependence is a throwback to the preindustrial world.
The Rise of the Beijing Consensus
At the diplomatic level, this implies that national interests, not universal norms, should drive cooperation.
The same will apply for other powers.
But this rising Beijing Consensus offers no guarantee of stability.
Overlapping spheres of influence and frozen conflicts could again cause major conflict.
A few decades ago, large organizations like multinational corporations or the Roman Catholic Church were the most typical type of transnational organization.
The use of the term "non-governmental organization" or "NGO" has increased 17-fold since 1992.
Royal Dutch Shell, for example, announced in 2003 that it would not drill in any spots designated by UNESCO as World Heritage sites.
Similar campaigns of naming and shaming have affected the investment and employment patterns of Mattel, Nike, and a host of other companies.
Not in the traditional sense of the word.
Non-governmental actors are changing world politics.
The new Penn World Table, Version 6.2, comparing standards of living across countries, has just been released.
The range between the poorest and the richest countries in the world is a factor of more than 100.
The average real per capita GDP of the top 25% of countries is 15 times that of the bottom 25%.
Watching these countries progress is like watching a marathon.
And yet they do not often overtake one another, because the distances between them are so large.
But real per capita GDP in the US is now three times higher than it was in 1958.
Environmental policy is clearly one.
Chinese shadow banking totals only about $2.2 trillion.
Since 2008, shadow banking has exploded, owing to price and regulatory factors.
They must understand this.
That pattern is changing.
Ten QE Questions
In particular, ten potential costs associated with such policies merit attention.
Asia’s Rebalancing Act
In any case, China’s stellar growth record cannot be sustained.
In China, labor inputs have fallen as a result of declining fertility and an aging population.
Reinforcing social safety nets, broadening and deepening financial markets, and supporting small and medium-size enterprises would also strengthen domestic demand.
Brave New Cells?
But “treatment” does not mean helping existing sufferers.
NEW YORK – Today’s swollen fiscal deficits and public debt are fueling concerns about sovereign risk in many advanced economies.
Policymakers are damned if they do and damned if they don’t.
So early fiscal consolidation can be expansionary on balance.
The Road Ahead in the Middle East
The goal today must be to modernize each tradition, while remaining faithful to its roots.
If it is to succeed in making the world a better place, globalization can not be predicated upon market forces alone, but needs to reinforce the stability and integration of diverse societies.
There should be a re-evaluation of the place of altruism and compliance with universal humanitarian norms.
BRATISLAVA: In the ten years of postcommunist transition, political reform has often been reduced to the issue of holding free elections.
Slovakia offers a positive example of such a rupture.
Six factors played a key role here:
-- a unified opposition respecting classic liberal values;
The Road from Depression
But it is more radical, because it puts the banks under European control.
The Road Map Includes Damascus
Many of the Hezbollah rockets that rained on Israel bore the markings of Syria’s Defence Ministry.
But what might Syria want?
Like his father, Assad is cautious.
Historically speaking, what is now happening is without precedent in the Arab world.
Russia reverted to a neo-authoritarian system.
The issue, one should emphasize, is not Islam as such: in Europe, the Catholic Church was for a long time the greatest enemy of democracy and liberalism.
It is to be hoped that there will be a light at the end of the tunnel in the Arab Middle East as well, but the tunnel may be a long one.
The Road to Depression
In other words, the “doom loop” isn’t really a loop at all.
It does end eventually, as it has – just for starters – in Iceland, Ireland, and Greece.
As the occupation force in Iraq, the coalition has undertaken international obligations, under the fourth Geneva convention, to uphold security and the rule of law.
It cannot simply ship them to Guantanamo Bay or Diego Garcia.
Only the UN can meet the demand for transitional justice.
But even such limited action is better than doing nothing.
The Road to Nuclear Disarmament
A world free of nuclear weapons is a global public good of the highest order. 
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, global military expenditures last year exceeded $1.3 trillion.
We have seen the WMD Commission led by Hans Blix, the New Agenda Coalition, and Norway’s Seven Nation Initiative.
The Council could also convene a summit on nuclear disarmament.
I support the creation of the Central Asian and African nuclear-weapon-free zones, and strongly support efforts to establish such a zone in the Middle East.
But these accounts seldom reach the public.
The exception was China, where the renminbi held steady against the dollar, causing an initial appreciation against almost every other currency.
That remains valid.
So what these countries need are more employment opportunities and higher salaries in the private sector for these workers.
But donors need to avoid some common mistakes.
Such moderation, taken alone, is welcome, of course.
Yet many are.
Regaining a well-functioning capitalism may be a steep mountain to climb.
Fifty years ago, on April 25, 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick published a short letter in the science magazine  Nature .
Both discoveries--DNA structure and protein structure--were made at Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory.
William Bragg graduated in mathematics in Cambridge in 1884, and became professor of physics in Adelaide, Australia.
In 1909 he returned to Britain to take up a chair at Leeds, continuing his work on the nature of X-rays.
Astbury, meanwhile, moved to Leeds in 1928, where he also began working on amino acids and proteins.
The results of this first defining moment in protein crystallography were published as a letter in  Nature in 1934.
He also obtained the first X-ray patterns of partially oriented samples of DNA. 
Max Perutz, a chemistry graduate from Vienna, arrived in Cambridge in 1935 to work as a graduate student with Bernal.
But proteins, which contain thousands of atoms, were far too complicated for this to work.
The Road to Tripoli
The two groups are drawn from a cross-section of society.
Some members held senior posts in Qaddafi’s government; others were social activists.
Events are showing that to be so. 
Will America face a bout of inflation?
Money put into reserves is income not spent.
The Root of All Sovereign-Debt Crises
By contrast, governments pay no penalties for outrageous misrepresentation or fraudulent accounting, as the Greek debacle shows.
Lending to governments against the collateral of a port or railroad – or the use of military force to secure repayment – was not unknown.
After the 1970’s, though, sovereign lending became institutionalized.
The Roots of America’s Financial Crisis
The Fed held this rate too low for too long.
All of this began to happen in the US.
There were a few naysayers, but not many in the financial sector itself.
But securing China’s growth has been anything but easy.
China’s macroeconomic policies are probably still too “administrative.”
History may provide some guidance here.
Steam power, factories, markets, and industry quickly spread throughout northwest Europe and its settler colonies.
Wouldn't Pakistan be much better off if it exported more of its textiles to the rich industrial world?
Of course.
They are threatened by roving bandits, by local notables, and, most of all, by government functionaries who use their offices to extort extra income.
Both nations have a long and complicated history with each other.
To achieve this, it will probably have to transcend its Marxists�Leninist heritage – something it has begun to do in important ways.
Likewise, there is unfinished business in many other countries undergoing reconstruction.
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), for example, just held its first elections in 40 years.
The stability of the Great Lakes region of Africa, perhaps that continent’s most violent area, will depend on the success of its transition and reconstruction.
Effective demobilization and reconciliation in El Salvador, for example, ensured the consolidation of peace after that country’s brutal civil war of the 1980’s.
Instead, with the strong approval of the IMF, East Timor created a Norwegian-style “petroleum fund” to save the money for a rainy day.
But in East Timor, that rainy day is now.
The motive seems to be brutally simple: “Precisely because you want it, we won’t deliver.
We can do what we like because we’re strong again.”
Russia is by no means seeking to isolate itself.
The Russians are Coming – With Cash
By design, these funds are intended to be invested outside Russia.
The Sarkozy Option
The answer is far from clear, and is probably a combination of both.
France is not in the same league in terms of power and influence as the US.
The Scaremongers of the Roundtable
It is not happening in Latin America or in socialist Sweden, but in the United States of America.
The SEC rule was an attempt to grant institutional investors this right.
It did it in a very mild format.
And even that would not suffice.
Is this the revolution that the Business Roundtable is afraid of?
Unfortunately, the scare tactics employed by the Business Roundtable worked.
Is a scientific answer possible?
More high-quality trials are needed.
By contrast, it is difficult to quantify how good clinical scientists are.
Most of my fellow male faculty members are not muscle-bound, testosterone-driven types, but in their scientific careers, they display two types of typically male behavior. 
As I grow older, I'm no longer sure why this is so important, but the male members of our species seem to think that it is.
Ten or 15 years from now, will anybody care?
There is a certain senior (male) faculty member who is one of the kindest and most accomplished investigators at my institution.
He is surrounded by and works with a group of young women he has mentored.
Although they generate as many of the ideas as their male colleagues do, it is the latter who go to meetings and present the group's research results.
In many places, that has begun to change.
The Scientific Road to Copenhagen
The meeting was chaired by Prince Albert.
But the story starts even before Tyndall, with the French genius Joseph Fourier.
In 1824, Fourier discovered why our planet’s climate is so warm – tens of degrees warmer than a simple calculation of its energy balance would suggest.
The sun brings heat, and earth radiates heat back into space – but the numbers did not balance.
Fourier realized that gases in our atmosphere trap heat.
He proved that some gases absorb radiant heat (today we would say long-wave radiation).
One of these gases was CO2.
His answer was 4-6 degrees Celsius (a little more than the 2-4 degrees that modern studies consistently find).
And, in 1979, the US National Academy of Sciences issued a stark warning of impending global warming.
Most countries now agree that global warming should be stopped at a maximum of two degrees centigrade.
In 1911, the diplomatic crisis over Morocco was accompanied by a French speculative attack on German financial markets.
The first is that the new worries are a strange case of psychological transference.
Wouldn’t an Italian company facing grid failure prefer to shut down French rather than Italian consumers?
Politicians like this because it increases demand for their services.
That bolsters his strength in the Russian setting.
The Search for Quality on the Web
NEW YORK – In the not-so-distant future, students will be able to graduate from high school without ever touching a book.
Indeed, today you can fit more books on the hard disk of your laptop computer than in a bookstore carrying 60,000 titles.
Search engines are the single most powerful distribution points of knowledge, wealth, and yes, misinformation.
It shaped a new generation of people who are strikingly different from their parents.
Baby boomers might be the best placed to appreciate this, since they experienced Rock 'n’ Roll as kids and Google as parents.
Google’s design was based on statistical algorithms.
In addition, statistics collection systems are backward-looking.
It is a billion-dollar industry.
For example, when a computer encounters the word “bill,” it would know that “bill” has 15 different meanings in English.
By contrast, “kill bill” would only be the title of the movie by that name.
At the end, a series of deductions like these would handle entire sentences and paragraphs to yield an accurate text-meaning representation.
Ontology is neither a dictionary nor a thesaurus.
It is a map of interconnected concepts and word senses that reflect relationships such as those that exist between the concepts of “bill” and “kill.”
But how would a semantic search engine solve the information quality problem?
Semantic technology can discern what it is.
WASHINGTON, DC – The race was tough, but US President Barack Obama has won re-election.
The question now, for the United States and the world, is what will he do with a fresh four-year term?
The Second Great Contraction
Why argue about semantics?
The aftermath of a typical deep financial crisis is something completely different.
But, in a “Great Contraction,” problem number one is too much debt.
But Great Contractions, as opposed to recessions, are very infrequent events, occurring perhaps once every 70 or 80 years.
Unfortunately, by now it is far too clear how wrong they were.
We don’t have answers to these questions.
The Secret of Harvard’s Success
Harvard was established as a public institution in 1636 by the authorities of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
When Harvard alumni dominated the Massachusetts legislature, the university was given support and consideration.
Inspired by Harvard’s success, other universities – starting with Yale University and the College of William and Mary – took similar action.
The only exception, the California Institute of Technology, has a board with 40% alumni representation.
Alumni run the show even at public institutions such as Purdue (90%) and Michigan (63%).
Given their intimate knowledge of the university, alumni are also the most effective leaders.
Through alumni networks, board members can acquire information quickly and act upon it without delay.
All great universities are nonprofit organizations, created to administer higher education, which benefits society as a whole.
But US universities found a way to integrate competition’s benefits into the European concept of nonprofit, or so-called eleemosynary, corporations.
Specifically, 60% of the requests filed in Romania met, compared to 31% in France and 24% in Spain.
Other countries that performed well include Peru and Mexico, both of which adopted freedom of information laws in 2002, shortly after Romania.
With its publication, Romania began to move away from its Securitate-dominated past.
Today, roughly 65 countries have such laws.
Such information is both a product and a motor of continuing reform.
The Secret World of Female Circumcision
NAIROBI – As a child in rural Kenya, I was a secret admirer of female genital mutilation.
My mother’s decision angered me.
The experience changed my life, but not in the way I expected.
I was mistaken.
An old woman bent over her, knife in hand.
In an instant, my view of female circumcision changed forever.
But punishment for the perpetrators of female circumcision remains rare.
The Secular and Sacred in Europe\u0027s Constitution
Silvio Ferrari, a noted scholar of Church‑State relations, dissects the issues.
The EU recognizes the "identity and specific contribution" of churches to European life.
Separation of church and state does not mean mutual ignorance.
If there is no equality, religious liberty is at risk.
It is here that efforts to include a reference to Europe's Judeo‑Christian heritage in the preamble of the Constitution must be considered dispassionately.
Of course, European civilization arises from a synthesis of religious and humanistic values.
Let’s start with ownership of foreign resources.
But this makes no economic sense.
Could the purchase of foreign resources lead to smoother national income?
WASHINGTON, DC – China and India are both racing ahead economically.
But the manner in which they are growing is dramatically different.
But the potential for explosive growth has usually been seen only in the manufacturing sector.
There is a new way ahead.
What followed was a seven-year play for extra time.
The Baker Plan was a universal disappointment.
Growth faltered again, and the International Monetary Fund actually reduced its lending.
The most obvious answer is that at an earlier stage in the Latin American saga, the banks simply could not have afforded to take such losses on their capital.
In Germany, the Dresdner Bank and the Landesbanken could not afford to take such a hit.
The Shadow of Depression
But what is the idea of Pakistan?
Despite his Anglophone status and Victorian manners, he carved out a separate homeland for India’s Muslims.
For the real Jinnah is now irrelevant in the country that reveres him as “Quaid-e-Azam,” or founder of the nation.
Jinnah’s idea of Pakistan – South Asian Muslim nationalism – has been overrun by the dogma of Islamic universalism.
Are you Pakistanis who happen to be Muslims, Christians, or Hindus?
But this must be a debate between people, and within people.
Nothing will be solved by searching for the “true Islam” or by quoting the Koran.
The Crescent has cast a seemingly interminable shadow across the length of Pakistan.
The vast majority of TB deaths occur in the developing world--largely induced by HIV.
Diagnosis is cheap, simple, and quick: for a few US cents, microscopic examination of a sputum smear can reveal the bacilli in less than 1 hour.
Only 148 out of 211 countries (45% of the world's population), however, are currently implementing it. 
We cannot control it in one country if there is an outbreak next door.
These patients often forgo treatment, and communication with them is difficult.
The Shape of America’s Recession
Japan's crisis is systemic, not cyclical.
The causes are a combination of institutional sclerosis, social anomie and gerontocratic governance.
So even as the Japanese tidal wave appeared poised to overwhelm the world economy in the late 1980s - remember "Japan Inc"? - the country was nearing collapse at home.
Collapse it did, in 1991.
The Silence of China\u0027s Intellectuals
Public opinion, as the crisis over the US spy plane demonstrated, now matters in China.
Both works – and others of the 1980s – mesmerized the public.
Repression is one reason.
Defiance, indeed, is now the exception rather than the rule.
But the government still is unwilling to listen.
Of course, it is not just oil prices that are high, but all commodity prices, from metals to food to lumber.
Earlier this month, jihadi terrorists ambushed an Egyptian military base in Sinai, killing 16 Egyptian soldiers.
They then hijacked two armored personnel carriers and sped toward the frontier with Israel.
But, as Mubarak’s regime declined, so did the government’s control over the Bedouin.
Israel wants, first and foremost, peace and stability.
Egypt’s government was humiliated and incensed by the recent terrorist provocation.
It started to occur to women that they could be employed and have a family – and that it could even be pretty nice.
As its power grows, China seems determined to choke off Asian competitors, a tendency reflected in its hardening stance toward India.
Even though India has more arable land than China – 160.5 million hectares compared to 137.1 million hectares – Tibet is the source of most major Indian rivers.
The Tibetan plateau’s vast glaciers, huge underground springs and high altitude make Tibet the world’s largest freshwater repository after the polar icecaps.
Indeed, all of Asia’s major rivers, except the Ganges, originate in the Tibetan plateau.
Even the Ganges’ two main tributaries flow in from Tibet.
Even denial of hydrological data in a critically important season can amount to the use of water as a political tool.
Local authorities in Yunnan province, however, are considering damming the Salween in the quake-prone upstream region.
But Tibet can still become a political bridge between China and India.
Nationalism, Madness, and Terrorism
These phenomena were connected.
In its original, English, form it was essentially democratic.
As it spread, it carried the seeds of democracy everywhere.
Modern culture cannot provide us with the consistent guidance that other cultures give to their members.
Indeed, foreigners at one time considered madness “the English malady.”
He was to be questioned to divulge the names of his co-conspirators and then executed.
It is a much bigger storm than any that has occurred since the end of World War II.
The theory holds that financial markets do not tend towards equilibrium.
That made the crisis more severe than any since World War II.
President Barack Obama has encapsulated this challenge by setting the goal of doubling US exports over the next decade.
But this is easier said than done.
Reversing this shift quickly seems impossible.
The same applies to real-estate agents, social workers, and managers of credit-card accounts.
How long will the US adjustment take?
The Sleeping Volcano of Global Finance
Ford and General Motors are in dire financial straits.
The Smartest Ways to Save the World
Later this year, donors will decide whether to renew this facility.
The Social Brain
But it even seems to form the heart of our humanity.
Compared with most other species, human beings are so immature at birth that they require an exceptionally long period of nursing and shelter.
This feedback enables proper production and, later, understanding, of emotion-related facial expressions that the subject herself cannot see.
Brain imaging studies have now shown that the human brain contains a similar mirror-neuron system (MNS).
For most people, physical feedback provided by muscle and tendon sensors helps in resolving this, as does proper communication between brain areas.
They also have poor mind-reading skills.
New imaging tools enable us to study these and other questions about human brain function more productively than ever before.
Spearheaded by worries about AIDS, activists around the world demanded that something be done.
They are mistaken.
During the Cold War, the Council was divided.
People do not live wholly by the word, but neither do they live solely by the sword.
Today, however, that Franco-German couple looks more like Europe's soft underbelly.
The motor has turned into a brake.
Neither, to be sure, has the Euro-skeptic British version of Atlanticism.
The Software of Life
Today’s buzzword in the study of life is “systems” biology.
“Systems” biology is biology that recognizes that what remains the same is the design of the boat – that which determines the relationships between the planks.
This required only the physical separation of the symbols (visualized as a tape) handled by the machine and the machine itself.
Moreover, the tape carried the data that allowed the machine to proceed.
As a result, many bacteria today produce human proteins.
But this represents only a small part of the genetic program.
Transfer of genes between organisms is widespread.
If we take this metaphor at face value, there is a surprising consequence.
However, the metaphor is limited by a simple fact: computers do not make computers.
This is an isolated question among many larger issues that await a negotiated peace agreement.
But the argument about legality is more complicated.
Indeed, some settlements are more than 25 years old and many settlers are a second or third generation of people living in the region.
Are they, as well as children brought there by their parents, collectively guilty just because some government officials might have violated the Rome Statute since July 2002?
The fence assumes that they, as a people, are the source of the deadly threats to the settlers.
Thus reigns the collectivist mentality that drives the unending feud between Jews and Palestinians.
The mainstream school defines China as a developing country, pointing to China’s per capita GDP, which ranks only 104th in the world.
And the sphere of concern for any humane ruler should be the whole world, not just the people of one state.
That warning has already proved to be correct.
The interest rate on ten-year Treasuries increased from about 4% in the mid-1960’s to 8% in the mid-1970’s and 10% in the mid-1980’s.
The Specter of Global Stagflation
The world has come full circle.
PRAGUE - A dominant feature of Prague is the Gothic tower of the Cathedral of St. Vitus, St. Wenceslas and St. Adalbert.
Allow me to return to the Cathedral of Saint Vitus, St. Wenceslas and St. Adalbert.
Why, in bygone ages, did people construct so costly an edifice, one with little use by today's standards?
The Spirit of September 12
The most important fact about the last decade is that, since 9/11, there has been no successful foreign terrorist attack in the US.
The Spring of the Zombies
The bottom may be near – perhaps by the end of the year.
This downturn is complex: an economic crisis combined with a financial crisis.
In a globalized world, problems in one part of the system quickly reverberate elsewhere.
But this is a synchronous global downturn.
The question is how long and deep this downturn will be.
And yet, do we act?
Yes, most of us live in peace and security. Yet violence is deepening in many nations: Afghanistan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, and Sudan.
Wealthy countries worry about recession, while the poor can no longer afford to eat.
Pledges have not been honored.
We have helped people affected by severe flooding in Southeast Asia, and by drought in the Horn of Africa, where 14 million need emergency help.
Must we wait – and see more children die in the sand?
Last year at this time, rice cost $330 a ton.
But we lack new resources.
Likewise, there is a real chance to reunify Cyprus.
In Cote d’Ivoire, we will help organize elections before year’s end – a major stride toward recovery and democracy.
We lack critical assets and personnel.
Climate change remains the defining issue of our era.
Indeed, it may prevent wider agreements from being negotiated.
No country likes to open its manufacturing dinosaurs to foreign competition.
The Stem-Cell Race Continues
Scientific research is usually conducted to improve our lives, but it is also an industry, one that represents a massive investment by governments and corporations alike.
We need to know how this transformation is activated.
Most attention is focused on genetic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, and to muscular dystrophy.
Discoveries occur incrementally, and, because it is science, each step is announced and tested.
The fraud has bewildered the science community, particularly because the claim that the Korean researchers made was so transparently false.
The Stimulus Ostriches
There is nothing novel about this.
As far as I can tell, they are simply burying their heads in the sand.
Then America’s businesses and investors discovered the Internet.
In both of these cases, large groups of people in America decided to increase their spending.
The government’s money is as good as anybody else’s.
The Storm Before the Calm
It is entirely possible that US inflation, measured over 12 months, will become negative by mid-2009..
The Storm in Sub-Saharan Africa
Sub-Saharan Africa depends heavily on commodity exports, so it is especially vulnerable to the global downturn.
These gains are now at risk.
This is not the time to renege on those commitments.
We are working closely with our 53 African members on crafting the appropriate policy response.
We are also stepping up our technical assistance to strengthen economic policy making in Africa, and opening two new regional technical assistance centers.
The US needs to create at least 150,000 jobs per month on a consistent basis just to stabilize the unemployment rate.
But net exports will be a drag on growth in 2012, for several reasons:
Liberal democracy and Islam are reconcilable.
To confuse culture and politics in this way is to fall into the same trap as the multiculturalists.
The Strange Death of Solidarity
Perhaps rise and fall is more of a cyclical than a linear phenomenon.
Or maybe it’s neither.
Americans don’t do this particularly well, however Byzantine their country’s own politics and policy-making may seem.
Which takes us back to structure.
That is still true, both at home and abroad.
The Streets of 2012
Ha’aretz calls the push “the new feudalism.”
The Stressed-Out Brain
This requires a thorough understanding of each animal species and its biology.
Evidence is gradually accumulating that the majority of mammalian research animals, particularly rodents, are mentally stressed by their living conditions.
Rodents, in particular, are sensitive to these noises, and studies show that this sensitivity does not diminish with time, as is commonly assumed.
Such devices enable animals to exert some control over their environment, such as escaping an attack from a cage-mate by moving to another level in the cage or hiding.
But the conclusions drawn from such experiments are specific to the stressed animals and cannot necessarily be extrapolated to healthy animals.
The increasing use of genetically modified mice since their advent 20 years ago amplifies this problem.
The exact conditions used to achieve these goals would probably vary between laboratories. But the end result would be similar.
HAMBURG – Roughly 60 years ago, the discovery of nuclear power promised the ultimate solution to the world’s energy problems.
The nuclei of their atoms usually decay into two smaller nuclei and a couple of neutrons, releasing many million times more energy than any chemical process ever could.
Therefore, for some time, it was not expected that the properties of the strong force could be directly derived from the properties of gluons.
But the precision experiments required to measure the strong force can be designed and built with known technology.
What’s Stopping Europe?
Bad advice.
Fiscal austerity is a poor substitute.
For several years, I have proposed a policy that combines growth and fiscal rectitude.

The Struggle for Mastery of the Pacific
TOKYO – On May 1, the Shanghai Expo began, illuminated by a huge fireworks display.
The Chinese navy, it is now believed, is trying to achieve that very aim.
It now appears that he wants to backtrack on his promise, but massive protests are inhibiting him from doing so.
South of Okinawa is Yonaguni Island, with a population of just 1,800 and visible from Taiwan on a clear day.
By controlling the sea lanes, China hopes to gain leverage over India’s capacity for economic growth.
The Struggle for Syria
Syria, after all, sits at the center of mighty and antagonistic geopolitical forces.
And to the north is Turkey, a pro-European, largely secular and democratic country that seeks to wield influence across the Arab world.
Fortunately, Syrians have no predilection for violence.
The Sugar Season
By 2020, that contribution is expected to rise to 73% of all deaths and 60% of the global burden of disease.
In China's rural areas, with more than 800 million people, NDC's account for more than 80% of deaths.
Transport ministries should provide safe roads so that children can bike to school.
The growing NCD and CVD burden is a time bomb for world health.
China has been celebrating the five year anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland from British rule.
The Financial Secretary, Anthony Leung, last year boasted that Hong Kong would become Asia's "Manhattan Plus."
Chief Secretary Sir Donal Tsang calls negative assessments of the territory the product of second-rate minds.
President Jiang and China's rulers have had very little, if anything, to do with any of these decisions.
But are they in tune?
What it wants now is the "two systems."
Nor is Mr. Tung alone.
The Summit of Low Expectations
Indeed, Chinese trade and investment are spurring market activity in North Korea’s northern region.
Both sides want to prevent any serious rupture.
The Sunflower Revolutionary
The Chinese official newspaper Global Times denounces Ai as a “maverick,” and mavericks are not tolerated in China.
But Ai never allowed himself to be hired as an official regime hack.
Other young Beijing artists have been detained as well.
The next targets will likely be independent writers like Ai Xiaoming, Dai Qing, Cui Weiping, and Han Han.
This process is nothing new.
Another writer, Li Xianbin, was sentenced to 10 years.
They must eventually confront each other on the field of a free conscience.
The alternative is to change the growth model in order to lighten the impact of higher levels of economic activity on natural resources and the environment.
But, while education and values are necessary, they clearly are not sufficient.
But too much coordination can be a bad thing.
Policies aimed at sustainability are likely to follow.
The Suzuki Alliance
TOKYO – The name “Suzuki” is the most popular surname in Japan and the brand name of the most popular car in India.
Suzuki Motor Corporation first entered the Indian market in 1982, when it started a joint venture with Maruti Udyog, an Indian state-owned firm.
The reason why Suzuki entered the Indian market is clear.
Suzuki chose an untapped market while Japan’s bigger automakers – Toyota, Nissan, and Honda – engaged in fierce competition within Japan.
Indeed, while there are currently more than 19,000 Japanese companies in the Chinese market, there are only about 260 in India.
These shared values distinguish the Japan-India relationship from Japan’s relationship with China.
Suzuki’s joint venture in India suggests that cooperation in high-tech manufacturing is eminently possible.
Look at Europe, many Europeans say, we have eradicated wars, dangerous nationalism, and dictatorships.
We created a peaceful European Union.
We are the moral continent.
Without the US Army, Western Europe would not have been liberated in 1945.
This is a new European illusion.
Spain's latter day appeasement à la Munich arises from this thinking.
You have the Great Satan and the Small Satan.
Ian Buruma, the British writer, claims that this European rage against America and Israel has to do with guilt and fear.
Rep. Donald Manzullo (R-Ill.) called for the resignation of N. Gregory Mankiw...”
They didn’t claim that what he said was inaccurate, or shortsighted, or analytically unsound.
That’s simply not the business they saw themselves as being in.
What can we do about this?
The Tails Wagging the Kremlin Dog?
MOSCOW – Imagine a crank who tries to pass himself off as a nineteenth-century Russian baron.
The virtuoso of such manipulation is Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.
In February, the Kremlin gave Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev $500 million for a promise to close America’s base in his country.
Fine, the Americans can have one base in Kyrgyzstan, and Russia can have two.
The Talmud and Greek Debt
The verse says, literally, “We (the court) force him until he says that he wants to do it willingly.”
There are two preponderant interpretations of the Talmudic passage.
This can be achieved by adopting some features of the model used in Eastern Europe, known as the “Vienna Initiative.”
But the initiative is insufficient, because the three pillars of the Vienna model are basically missing.
Therefore, under this model – and despite the initial pressure – the behavior of bondholders could be considered truly voluntary.
The Tea Party’s Modest Proposal
So, while a budget deal would technically be easy to achieve, it looks politically impossible in the near term.
It remains to be seen whether the US Federal Reserve will also feel constrained by the political mood on Capitol Hill.
NEW DELHI – The fallout from the terror attacks in Mumbai last week has already shaken India.
The terrorists hit multiple targets in Mumbai, both literally and figuratively.
For this reason, the US is likely to press India not to contemplate forceful retaliation that could undermine America’s objectives in Afghanistan.
Yet inaction is not an option.
The Terrorist Temptation
Fascism's demise was followed by the more gradual disintegration of communism after Stalin's death and Khrushchev's revelations of Stalin's crimes.
But by the early 1980's social democracy had exhausted itself.
Both were to be achieved within a liberal order.
Indeed, it was no more than an episode.
Some of us always suspected that the Schroeder-Blair idea of "New Labour" or, in German, the "New Center," had no real basis.
Whoever governs must try to square this circle.
The Third Way is A Rightwing Way
This insight is particularly useful in Europe, and increasingly around the globe, when examining the actions of supposedly leftwing and socialist governments.
In the late 1950s France came near to civil war over Algeria.
Out of power since 1946, Charles de Gaulle was summoned back to the Elysée to lead France out of this quagmire.

It does not need to be "represented."
The phrase has no deeper meaning.
Today, each township has hundreds.
Such people are more likely to seek to strengthen their privileges than promote pluralism and the rule of law.
The Three Swedish Models
But Sweden’s system has varied considerably.
In fact, broadly speaking there have been three different Swedish “models” since the late nineteenth century.
The first model lasted from about 1870 until the 1960’s.
In other words, Sweden became a rich country  before its highly generous welfare-state arrangements were created. 
A second era lasted from 1960 until 1985.
The regulation of financial markets that was imposed during WWII was retained.
In 1991, marginal tax rates were cut by 10-20% for large parts of the population.
Out of Iraq’s total population of around 28 million, four million are displaced and two million have fled the country.
The Time is Now to Fight Disease
But this can only happen with considerable investment.
Upping the ante could turn the tables.
Unchecked, these diseases not only sap the strength of national economies, but jeopardize peace and security.
The Tobin Tax Lives Again
That would be quite an incentive for self-monitoring.
And it would not dissuade governments intent on pursuing unsustainable monetary and fiscal policies financed by external borrowing.
Protectionism may, in fact, be an electoral dinosaur.
In any event, history’s great statesmen have always earned their spurs by bucking the political odds for a matter of principle.
In the critical vote for repeal that brought his political career to an end, Peel won only 106 votes from his Conservative Party, while 222 Tory MPs opposed him.
The other example is Winston Churchill, who was elected as a Conservative member of Parliament from the northern industrial town of Oldham.
After converting to free trade in 1904, he had to leave the party.
He then joined the Liberal Party, accepting the invitation of the Liberal Association of Northwest Manchester.
The Torturers of Tashkent
They then transported Tuychiyev to a police station in Angren, 100 kilometers south of the capital.
By the next morning, Tuychiyev was dead.
Four police officers are on trial for his killing.
The report unleashed a wave of criticism of the EBRD for choosing to hold its meeting in Tashkent.
Thereafter, torture in Uzbekistan became routine.
(Psychological research shows that torture causes serious psychological trauma to its victims, whose families often suffer negative consequences as well.)
I had a chance to see one of the victims of Uzbekistan’s regime.
Rasul Haitov was 27 years old when he was detained in Tashkent with his brother Ravshan, 32, in October 2001.
Police officers resorted to torture to get them to admit that they were members of an Islamist party, Hizb-ut Tahrir.
The police choked the brothers with plastic bags.
They drove needles under their fingernails, and then tore them out.
When I saw him in a courtroom, he was weak and feeble and looked like a broken old man.
The Trade-and-Aid Myth
Now consider a second country.
Now consider their economic performance.
The word “diamond” hardly conjures images of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.
Chen once had political courage.
Those who the gods may destroy, they grant their wishes.
Football has always been this way.
Zidane offered neither of these romantic images.
Here is a man who was not only a world champion, but also a model son and father.
But now the hero has fallen.
Zidane was not Superman, but a human being.
Moreover, the US and Europe face a similar challenge: encouraging economic recovery.
Europe would inevitably be forced to coordinate its policies with America. 
Probably not.
So the US is likely to opt for growth. 
The Transatlantic Index
The Alliance is “up” for one key reason: the warming of France’s relations with the US following Nicolas Sarkozy’s election as French president.
Indeed, 73% said they had never experienced discrimination while living in America.
America’s Muslims do not so much assimilate as participate in economic, political, educational, and social life.
Why do US Muslims do well while remaining devout and distinctive-looking?
They allow people of many creeds to work in them—a workplace of multiple faiths.
They should be allowed to work.
His rhetoric soared.
His rhetoric did not soar, could not soar.
His sentences parsed.
Each time, his performance was flat.
The truth appears to be that his muse deserted him sometime in the first year of his presidency.
He found it in the idea of reconciliation – both racial and ideological.
It was to be the theme of his presidency.
The Obama of 2008 is not back.
The Transition to Sustainability
This is not easy to do.
Such conjunctures create what the author Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls “Black Swans” – unpredictable events with a vast impact.
Because all the derivatives were based on the same assets, if anything happened to those assets, all the banks holding the debt would find themselves in the same soup.
This view draws on the ‘Austrian’ theory of booms and slumps, and also Milton Friedman’s explanation of the Great Depression of 1929.
Greenspan is the sacrifice they offer to the god of the market.
The Treason of the Magistrates
In France, Paris magistrates attempted for years to indict former President Jacques Chirac on charges of corruption.
In that case, the label fit.
He was no longer able to work, travel, choose his place of residence, buy or sell property, or even marry.   
In Russia, roughly 125,000 people with mental disabilities are confined to institutions – for life.
There are another 165,000 beds in psychiatric hospitals, with some 650,000 hospitalizations per year.
It is astonishing how little is known about the treatment of people with mental health problems in Russia.
Indeed, in some ways it is a step backwards.
Chile used these measures efficiently and effectively during the first part of the 1990s.
Moreover, countries with heavy short-term indebtedness risk their political autonomy.
The underlying US government philosophy is that American producers are better than those of any country.
The idea is not merely academic: Australia and New Zealand, in their free-trade agreement, did something along these lines.
So those who celebrate the new US/Chile trade agreement should be cautious.
NEW YORK – It was early June 1989.
Then 40,000 people will fill Wenceslas Square!”
Twenty years later, we can only marvel at how brilliantly they performed.
The theme music was the Velvet Underground.
The audience, of course, was the world.
We watched it happen on TV.
Disney could not have worked a more seductive transformation.
It helped that this revolution could be counted in days, a miracle of compression.
If so, the dénouement came on December 29, the day Vaclav Havel became a free Czechoslovakia’s new president.
Slowly, the procession wound its way along paths through Letná’s woods, now covered in white.
Slowly, it snaked down the medieval streets behind Prague Castle and into the square in front of the president's palace.
Hand in hand, they bisected the city.
Here, on one side, stood the people, on the other their oppressors.
This was the moment.
Everyone had to choose.
Prague lay away in the distance, lighted and luminous in the snow.
The Triumphant Return of John Maynard Keynes
NEW YORK – We are all Keynesians now.
Not even the interests of their own shareholders have been served well.
Little was done.
For the Party, however, Bo’s conviction will not mark the end of the scandal.
This follows a similar official response to Chen Liangyu’s philandering and to Chen Xitong’s “Five Golden Flowers.”
So Bo is anything but a tragic figure.
And, for a little more than a decade, from 1997-2007, this hope was realized.
That would have been sufficient to pay back the entire Italian national debt over about a decade and a half.
Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio today, at 120%, is as high as it was when the country entered the eurozone in the mid-1990’s.
But who is to make these guarantees?
For many years, Italy has disregarded the debt ceilings imposed by the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact.
It is seen as a long saga full of surprises.
The Trouble with Japanese Nationalism
That is an unconvincing stance.
In fact, unlike Germany, Japan has never come to terms with its own responsibility for the Pacific War.
(I am regularly sent books by Japanese writers that “explain” how the Nanjing Massacre was a big fraud.)
What is not to like?
The Trouble with Poland
“We are only demanding one thing, that we get back what was taken from us….If Poland had not had to live through the years 1939-1945, it would be a country of 66 million.”
Kaczynski’s words, however, stand in contradiction with what happened in Paris this July 14th.
In the nineteenth century, Europe’s southern and eastern extremities were united by common decay.
And perhaps there is another factor: there is more pride and less self-doubt in Spanish culture than in the Polish one.
To deny this, to threaten to undo Polish-German reconciliation, is to harm Poland’s fundamental national interests.
The other path Poland can take is that of Spain.
In the course of the last five years, while teaching at the College of Europe in Natolin, near Warsaw, I have witnessed at first hand Poland’s remarkable progress.
But should we be skeptical of all ``talking treatments?''
The wife driven to depression by her husband's infidelity.
Or the teenager disabled by obsessive compulsive disorder.
For them finding skilled psychological therapies and therapists is rarely easy, even though in all of these instances the evidence of effectiveness is beyond dispute. 
It seems better to concentrate on delivering effective treatments to the smaller number of people who really need them, and not on the larger number of people who don't. 
First, people are more resilient than we give them credit for.
The most important things in life ­ like life itself ­ are priceless.
EXETER – Many people ask how sure we are about the science of climate change.
How does one decide what is a fair contribution from a country of 50 million people compared to a country with only four million?
How can you evaluate a contribution of light infantry against the provision of critical enablers such as helicopters or air-to-air refueling tankers?
Immanuel Kant famously argued otherwise – that morality should be free of non-universal interests.
In some cases, the defense of interests alone might seem appropriate –&#160;for example, in certain business transactions.
The Truth About the Yugoslav Truth Commission
The resemblance ends there.
The contrast in Yugoslavia is stark.
Parliament was not involved. The Yugoslav President acted on his own.
Could the Commission obtain their testimony outside Yugoslavia?
President Kostunica is also slated to participate.
The Tsunami Effect
More common is a situation like that of ex-Yugoslavia.
The Tunisian Catalyst
First, the lessons.
Even providing good education may not suffice.
High unemployment and pervasive corruption, however, create a combustible combination.
So constitutions need to be flexible.
The Turkish Chimera
As a result, its model cannot easily be transplanted.
Moreover, the Turkish model owes much to the leadership of Kemal Ataturk, founder of the Turkish Republic.
They also lack a vibrant civil society.
ISTANBUL – The small park in Taksim Square in the sprawling metropolis of Istanbul is one of the few green spaces left in the city center.
Overall, however, the movement has remained peaceful and even joyous.
That has weakened center-left parties.
PARIS – No tumbrils have appeared in Paris’s Place de la Concorde, but a revolution may be underway in France nonetheless.
True enough, some aristocratic heads rolled, but the nobility eventually returned to France.
All this has changed.
So, something of a democratic revolution may be underway in France.
The ancien regime’s supporters call it a “populist” revolution.
But it is a revolution made in the courts, not the streets.
French judges have become more independent than they traditionally were.
Sarkozy understands the new rules of the game.
As soon it was known that he had an intimate relationship with a former fashion model, he decided to marry her, avoiding any further embarrassment.
Sarkozy’s son, Jean, has already been elected to a major local government office at the tender age of 22.
Young Sarkozy withdrew.
France, it seems, does not yet share the real democratic culture of, say, Scandinavia.
French ministries still occupy the former eighteenth-century palaces of the King and his nobility.
Sharif is planning a grand entrance.
Some in Washington charge that he has done too little to roust al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters from safe havens along the country’s border with Afghanistan.
Adding to the pressure, America would expect the kind of cooperation in pacifying Pakistan’s tribal areas that Musharraf has proven unable to provide.
This won't happen automatically or overnight.
Instead, Europe should draw on two periods of community building.
Medieval Christianity in its 13th-century formed a community united around a common faith, with Rome as its unifying power center.
Saint Peter's successors as Roman pontiffs oversaw a network of Church-run universities which educated cultural elites in the same way and in the same language (Latin).
A network of churches--built in the same style throughout Europe--shared a common calendar and liturgy.
The answer seems to revolve around the central place that European civilisation has given the human person since mixing barbarian customs with Christianity.
This anthropocentric vision is carried by the Christian tradition in the message that man is made in the image of God and that the Son of God sacrificed himself for man.
ROME: Italy's economy has two faces.
For example, the mechanical industries in the Veneto and in Emilia led by Carararo, and Ducati, as well as the optical industry in the Northeast with Luxottica in the lead.
This percentage is lower today than in 1970, while in the United States the equivalent number has increased from 65% to 78%.
When a man works and marginal tax rates are very high, the wife very often prefers to stay at home.
The Chamber of Deputies is poised to enact a law only the White Queen in Alice in Wonderland could love.
Alexander's formula is also popular today with Putin’s nationalists in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
Putin sees his own crusade to save Russia from disintegration and separatism as similar to Alexander’s.
Stalin is yet another cherished role model.
Previously, it was Russia’s Western mission that was pure Potemkin village.
The Tyranny of King Cotton
Cotton illustrates the problem.
The Ultimate Computer
Such advances in the processing speed and storage capacity of computers are expected to continue until the laws of physics impose certain limits.
After all, we cannot shrink atoms or increase the speed of light. 
Hold that thought. 
For example, it implies that elementary particles, rather than being located at one position at a time, travel on several trajectories simultaneously. 
But our ordinary common sense does not apply in fundamental physics.
What would happen inside a quantum computer when it performs an algorithmic search?
A growing minority of physicists, myself included, accept the ``many universes'' interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Grover's algorithm is one.
Other known quantum algorithms will easily be able to crack the most widely used secure cryptographic systems of today.
As the physicist Seth Lloyd commented, ``almost anything becomes a computer if you shine the right kind of light on it.'' 
Early ratification of the US-Russia START treaty would be a step in the right direction.
The CTBT is needed because of the role of nuclear tests in the development and improvement of nuclear weapons.
No other organization is held in such respect as the United Nations.
In July 1995, Serb forces attacked.
The Dutch fired not a single shot.
NATO air power could have halted the Serbs, but Annan did not ask for NATO intervention.
He never allowed himself to be duped by Hitler's cronies.
Perhaps no one's achievement should be judged by comparison with that of Wallenberg - a titan of strength, courage, and perseverance.
The UN’s Mandate Gap
UN Security Council Resolution 1701 “calls for Israel and Lebanon to support a permanent ceasefire.”
But ROEs are only the symptom of a deeper problem.
It’s political theater - big headlines, small results.
But over a month after the resolution, barely 5,000 troops are deployed.
How will communications infrastructure be rebuilt?
Who will repair Lebanon’s bridges and roads?
The UN Takes Charge
The US and other advanced industrial countries pushed globalization.
Of all of the G-8’s promises over the years, the most important was made to the world’s poorest people at the 2005 G-8 Gleneagles Summit in Scotland.
The solution is ultimately political, not military.
Iran might eventually turn into the graveyard of Obama’s dream of a world without nuclear weapons.
George Bernard Shaw once observed that “in the arts of peace Man is a bungler.”
The Japanese Experiment
This response is part of the transmission mechanism for the Japanese government’s policies.
Here the risk involves currency wars and other beggar-thy-neighbor disruptions.
CHICAGO – It is amazing how the “one percent” epithet, a reference to the top 1% of earners, has caught on in the United States and elsewhere in the developed world.
In the United States, this 1% includes all those with a 2006 household income of at least $386,000.
But apart from tarring too many with the same brush, there is something deeply troubling about this narrative’s reductionism.
“We are the 90%,” sounds less dramatic than “we are the 99%.”
The US has tried quick fixes before.
The ending, as everyone knows, was not a happy one.
The Unended Recessional
When a state has more than one colonial past, its future is vulnerable.
Ethnicity or language hardly seem to be a factor in the secessions (one recognized, the other not) of Eritrea from Ethiopia and the ``Republic of Somaliland'' from Somalia.
The war that erupted in 1991 in no small measure pitted those parts that had been ruled by the German-speaking empires against those that avoided such colonization.
State failure in the wake of colonialism is another source of conflict.
We will not create a better world in the 21 st century by forgetting what happened in the 19 th and much of the 20 th .
“Fiscal adjustment” is jargon; what austerity is always about is the distribution of income.
Now it’s America’s turn.
Today’s children did not play a role in any of these policy mistakes.
The preschoolers who are about to lose access to Head Start weren’t even born when they were made.
But the end of confrontation in Europe may be proving only temporary.
Our hope was for unification with Europe, a “common European home,” and the creation of a Europe “united and free.”
NATO enlargement wouldde facto be frozen.
Kosovo, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia must be the last of the states that break away through force.
DNA at 60
LONDON – On April 25, 1953, Francis Crick and James Watson published a one-page paper that many believed would revolutionize biological research.
The golden moment that changed us all.”
To some extent, they are right.
“We will have extra limbs, if we want them,” he asserted, “maybe even wings to fly.”
Common variants typically explain a small fraction of genetic risk.
But patients are not the only variable.
In addition, as the cancer adjusts to the drug, further mutations are likely to occur, diminishing the drug’s efficacy.
But such patents mar DNA’s “birthday” celebrations for the patients who stand to benefit from the fruits of genetic research – if only they could afford them.
Some of them have grown back of course, or have been replanted, but it is thought that we now have only half of the amount of forest land we once had on this planet. 
The landscape has been permanently altered. 
And here’s the part that should bring tears to your eyes: we continue to lose more forest cover every year. 
The more recent losses are well documented.
I will not be surprised when it is released and I read that the global forest area has continued to shrink. 
In the United States, deforestation began as soon as the colonies were settled.
By 1920, more than three-quarters of the US’s original forests had been cut.
Similar to the global figures, today the US has only half the forest cover that it had in 1600.
And we continue to destroy forest land. 
At the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro it was agreed that, “efforts should be undertaken towards the greening of the world.”
Last week, I went to a zoning meeting in the town where I live.
A real estate housing project developer wanted to cut many acres of trees so he could build houses.
Why do local politicians, tree lovers all, allow yet more forest destruction?
But we do not fear trees.
This is a major mistake.
The Union and the Dragon
Will China and the EU be competitors or partners?
The first are economic.
But speedy growth always incites turbulence, which China will have to minimize and manage.
Indeed, sustainable development is a challenge for both China and Europe.
A recent UN report warned that we have already entered the danger zone.
Chinese interests are served by a Middle East marked by regional cooperation.
But it is deeds that matter.
It is time to replace the old cooperation agreement between the Union and China, dating from 1985.
The EU’s political standards are high, but the fruits of cooperation are sweet.
I am confident that this is not the case.
Ultimately, this will not be enough.
Extended delay is unlikely to be met with extended tolerance.
The Universe in a Grain of Sand
One speculated that these new high energies, when combined with the specific way the particles would be broken, would annihilate us.
The purpose of the Large Hadron Collider is to create an unprecedented situation.
For most people, the topics that excite physicists do not seem to affect daily life in the slightest.
For example, consider how different the world was before the concept of “zero” was discovered.
Zero is essential to bookkeeping and hence all modern commerce.
And that is quite apart from the way we take for granted the idea of “nothing.”
One is based on number; the other is based on form.
The other posits that the universe is inherently geometric, and that geometric properties, such as symmetry, govern it.
If the experiment finds the predicted particle, it will tilt the argument toward form.
When you just read the word “symmetry,” you probably thought about two balanced halves, or a reflection.
The Unknown Promise of Internet Freedom
A readers’ poll in the Sydney Morning Herald showed 96% opposed to those proposed measures, and only 2% in support.
The Internet, like the steam engine, is a technological breakthrough that changed the world.
Reality is more complex.
Nonsense.
You will find someone online with whom to share them.
Can’t get to a doctor?  You can check your symptoms online – but can you be sure that the medical Web site you are using is reliable?
The Unraveling of Europe’s Peace
Attracting neighbors has long been a noble aspiration – and something of a European specialty.
In an unrelated move, Denmark did the same, ostensibly to prevent cross-border crime.
Grand Mal Economics
And, indeed, the North Atlantic region’s governments and central banks have tried to some degree.
But that book was published in 2007 – before, presumably, his intellectual structure fell apart.
How is this trick accomplished?
No intervention by government is needed.
Bailing out inefficient automobile companies like General Motors only slows down the rate of progress.
But this was not used to finance new inventions: it was the invention.
But those sentiments are a world away from the pretty, polite techniques of his mathematical progeny.
On May 11, some 40-50 million voters will elect a new national assembly.
The role of the military in politics also needs to be resolved.
It is not often recognized that Pakistan has the world’s second-largest Shia population, after Iran, with roughly 50 million adherents.
But the coalition proved unable to translate political success into strong economic performance.
The Uptick’s Downside
Civilizing the City
BANGALORE – Half of humanity – 3.5 billion people – live in urban areas today.
But cities are simply unable to cope with the influx of migrants on the current scale.
Infrastructure spending is either inadequate or poorly targeted.
They feel unsafe on poorly-lit streets, and have little access to parks or recreational facilities.
Already, there have been major strikes at factories across China – Motorola, Honda, and Foxconn, among others.
Of the world’s ten most densely populated cities, seven are in India.
It currently invests only $17 per capita, compared to $116 in China and $292 in the United States.
This is why I have set up the Nammu Bengaluru (“Our Bangalore”) Awards.
Globalizing the Security Council
At its inception, the UN brought together 51 countries; it now has 193 member states.
A majority of UN member states are in favor of creating a new Council with an expanded roster of both permanent and non-permanent members.
The Sino-American Mirror
To some extent, the two countries’ problems are mirror images of each other.
Yet the two leaders and their administrations must overcome monumental challenges as their countries strive to reach the next stage of their development.
The Sino-American Test in North Korea
Nobody wants war on the Korean Peninsula.
Sino-North Korean relations have borne a significant scar since 1991, when China recognized South Korea without insisting that the US formally recognize the North.
Given these conditions, even a small spark could ignite a wildfire.
This is a good starting point.
But domestic politics in both countries stand in the way.
China greatly resented it when the US endorsed the Japanese position.
With the exception of the peaceful transition of world leadership from Britain to the US after World War I, such global power shifts have always involved armed conflict.
China was farsighted when it adopted the doctrine of harmonious development, but recently it has veered from it.
America’s Third-World Politics
None of these claims was true.&nbsp;
The Uses and Abuses of Economic Ideology
But it did determine assumptions about the appropriate nature and limits of intervention.
The financial sector dominates non-academic employment of professional economists.
Understanding these social and cultural processes could itself be an important focus of new research.
Such guiding philosophies are most compelling when they provide clear answers.
The Uses of Corruption in China
The Usual Suspect
Now this is, to say the least, a highly unusual situation.
The Vagina Chronicles
Many of the reactions to my book tend to confirm that belief.
(They are inhibited, of course, when women fear being stoned, mocked, shamed, raped or brutalized in response to their desire).
The Value of a Pale Blue Dot
What does astronomy tell us about “the starry firmament above”?
The astronomer Carl Sagan suggested that the Voyager space probe capture an image of earth as it reached the outer reaches of our solar system.
It did so, in 1990, and Earth shows up in a grainy image as a pale blue dot.
That’s probably true, even though scientists are now discovering other planets outside our solar system.
So, you finally passed that crucial piece of legislation?
Good for you!
This is as true of South Korea and Taiwan in the 1960’s and 1970’s, as it is of Argentina today.
These are just some of the better-known examples.
While the central bank bears a good part of the responsibility, it needs support from other parts of the government, most notably from the finance ministry.
This can be done without announcing a specific target level for the exchange rate.
The Value of European Values
Both principles lie at the crossroads of philosophy, politics, economics, sociology, and law.
They are, in short, inscribed in the EU's history and ideals.
The best-known application of this principle is federalism.
In the European Treaties, we find a clear expression of vertical subsidiarity.
It encompasses the relations between state, society, and market.
So the problem comes in assuring the autonomy of each realm.
This support, however, should be implemented in ways that the natural potential of individuals, society, and the market is promoted.
That is the spirit in which the European Constitution must be written.
Race-Based Medicine?
Although the issues are complicated, the solution is simple: follow the data.
This approach is not new.
Clearly, genetic markers are useful in designing clinical trials.
In 1996, inconclusive clinical trials led US regulators to reject the drug.
Although BiDil has not been a great commercial success since its approval in 2009, it remains on the market.
The Vanished Intellectual
Aron was born on March 14, 1905, Sartre on June 21.
Consider three examples.
The slogan “Knowledge is power” may be familiar, but only intellectuals see its full implications.
Sparked by Poland’s Solidarity movement, the Warsaw Pact dissolved, the Soviet Union disintegrated, and the bipolar world and its East-West divide vanished.
The Vanishing Swedish Exception?
Sweden's economy rose and fell with the IT bubble, reflected in telecoms giant Ericsson's troubles today.
In 1970, GDP per head was the fourth highest in the world; now it is 17 th place in the OECD.
The Varieties of Unemployment
And if unemployment in Europe and North America stays elevated for two or three more years, it is highly likely that we will have to face it.
Employment is up in health care, Internet-related businesses, and perhaps in logging and mining.
But that is not our problem now.
The Veil Wars
Barack Obama’s words echo those of Clinton.
China took from 1989 the lesson that state stability was paramount.
Chinese power today comes not from its ability to match America’s blue-water navy, but from its holdings in US Treasury bonds.
The Virtual Enemy
Terrorist motivations differ from cell to cell, even from person to person.
The characteristics of this new structure have already been studied in a very different context.
A conspicuous example already exists in the movie production industry.
The benefits of virtual enterprises stem from their lightness over stability.
When you buy a car from General Motors, 80 cents from each dollar goes to GM, which mostly only manages itself.
Terrorists have been better at capitalizing on models of distributed operation.
The best known in the West is The Management of Savagery , but only because it was translated and made public.
That is why the Bush administration’s actions actually strengthen the virtual terrorist enterprise dynamic.
Today, two sorts of books exist: those to be read and those to be consulted.
End of book; end of reading experience.
The same happens even if you read philosophy, say, Husserl.
The author opens at the fist page, and follows a series of questions in order for you to see how he reaches his conclusions.
I can do my job in a few seconds.
But although computers are diffusing a new form of literacy, they are incapable of satisfying all the intellectual needs they stimulate.
The first is a copying machine through which you scan library catalogues and the books of publishing houses.
This will change all publishing; it will probably eliminate bookstores but not books.
The second invention is the e-book: by inserting a micro cassette into the spine or by connecting it with the Internet, you will have your book.
But this book is as different as the first Shakespeare folio of 1623 is from the latest Penguin edition.
Some people who say that they never read printed books are now reading, say, Kafka, in an e-book.
To understand why, we must draw a distinction between systems and text.
A system is all the possibilities displayed by a given natural language.
A text, however, reduces the infinite possibilities of a system to form a closed universe.
Take the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood.
And so on. The notion of authorship is thrown in doubt.
This has sometimes happened in the past without disturbing authorship.
Another example is a jazz jam session.
We may believe there is a privileged performance of “Basin Street Blues” because a recording survives.
But there were as many Basin Street Blues as there were performances.
But there is a difference between infinite, unlimited texts and texts which can be interpreted in infinite ways but are physically limited.
Make “War and Peace” into a hypertext and you can rewrite the story: Pierre kills Napoleon or Napoleon defeats General Kutusov.
In Les Miserables Victor Hugo provides us with a beautiful description of Waterloo.
LONDON – Politicians are masters at “passing the buck.”
The economy is a classic field for this strategy.
But this is to turn the matter on its head.
Of course, it will not be carried through to the bitter end.
In the United Kingdom, there is already talk of Plan A +.
If today’s accounting rules are too insensitive to make this distinction, a separate entity could do the investing.
There are signs that officials in the UK and the United States are starting to move in this direction.
In the long run, the eurozone must be recognized as a failed experiment.
For example, the planned portion of the wall that reaches the settlement of Ariel, deep inside the West Bank, extends 15 kilometers inside Palestinian territories.
The Walls of August
Fifty years ago this month, the Berlin Wall was born.
But, in August 1991, ordinary Muscovites stood their ground.
But five years after the brutal suppression of the demands for freedom heard in Budapest, Khrushchev was not fully convinced of the need to divide Berlin.
Had the Wall not been built in 1961, would communism have collapsed sooner?
Iraq’s children have suffered more than just successive wars and economic sanctions.
Other children load and transport items in the markets, where they must pull carts weighing 60-70 kilograms and carry boxes weighing 15 kilograms in temperatures of 50 degrees centigrade.
Two children may unload a truck carrying 1,000 kilograms of food items.
They must perform household chores and are subject to beating if they do not carry out orders issued by male family members.
The War Against Iraqi Women
The goal of the PVPV is to confine women to the domestic realm and end all female participation in public and political life.
So must the US.
It must begin today.
Saddam's power came from his control of the world's second largest oil reserve.
The logic is simple.
Tensions may remain high for years.
The War of the Words
As Turks well know, it is dangerous to take a position on the Armenian genocide of 1915.
But these gestures of cooperation with Muslim sensibilities have not been met by reciprocal gestures.
All the international precedents – from Nuremberg to the present – concern international intervention after mass atrocities.
It happened in Palestine, and it could well happen in Egypt if free and fair free elections were held.
In such instances, military assistance may be relevant; in others, intervention may be necessary.
Governments should establish regular contacts among agencies responsible for both the technical and policy dimensions of homeland security.
Homeland security is an international issue.
In the case of biological agents, world public health has become a security issue.
Advocates say that it is a crucial tool for "draining the swamps."
There will be no equivalent to the fall of Baghdad, and no silver bullet in the struggle against terrorism.
Success will require investment in a wide range of instruments.
The War Over the Settlements
What is the objective of this policy of expansion in the occupied territories?
Given magnitude of settlement and the power of vested interests, a forced evacuation of the occupied territories is unthinkable.
Let's make a rough estimate.
If 60-70% of settlers were willing to return to Israel, this would amount to 130,000-150,000 people or approximately 25,000-30,000 families.
A system of foreign investment, pivoting on London, channeled the savings of rich (or surplus) countries to the poor (or deficit) countries.
This far-sighted Chinese proposal never left the drawing board.
We can learn from the experience of the 1930’s.
In various speeches, he warned against fiddling with the party's Leninist foundation.
Both Li and Zeng urge cadres to learn from America's democratic system.
In alliance with Li, they would form a formidable force, one likely to enjoy high-level support from senior party elders like Wan Li, Qiao Shi, and Tian Jiyun.
The Washington Protests
The City of London and Seattle were the first to be besieged.
But should we take these screams seriously?
Are these protests representative of a widespread rejection of the way the world economy is working?
-- No to IMF programs that hurt workers and the poor.
-- No to secretive global institutions.
The Way Ahead on Climate Change
This week’s gathering in Poznan is an important step.
Meanwhile, the clock is ticking.
For example, with the right investments, tropical countries could significantly reduce emissions from the forestry sector while also creating green jobs.
It is an energy, finance, and security issue.
The United States is the worst offender.
Nevertheless, Europeans generally agree that their societies produce the best lifestyles, even if their economies are less efficient than America’s in a Darwinian sense.
The Way Out of Iraq
The only question is how to satisfy it.
Much ground must be covered to get anywhere close.
But there is not enough time for that.
The Cooperation for Peace and Unity (CPAU) provides a model of how this can be done.
He now visits the Committee offices regularly.
But no economist can say when is "when."
Anyone who says he believes in a "strong orange policy" would be ridiculed.
Keynes once described asset markets as beauty contests, in which the objective is not to ascertain who is the most beautiful person, but whom others will think is the most beautiful.
The response was that the strong dollar meant a strong economy, and a strong economy strengthens the ability to export.
The strong dollar policy reeks of an economic nationalism that is out of step with the era of globalization.
If the dollar is strong, then the euro or the yen is weak.
Paul O'Neill should be commended for helping in this effort.
The Wealth of Species
Remedial action can no longer be delayed. 
Extinctions are only the tip of the iceberg.
Extinct or endangered species are indicators of a much bigger problem.
Why care about the loss of biodiversity?
Clearly, the loss of fish stocks deprives our palates, and puts parts of our food supply at risk.
But much more is at stake.
We also mine natural systems for pharmaceuticals.
So why haven't the world's peoples united to solve the problem?
But doubts are growing.
PARIS – It is usually easier to see the beginning of something than the end of it.
At best, like in Sweden or Denmark, the welfare state stopped expanding.
As a consequence, the national health-care scheme actually provides a net benefit for the average income earner.
Every year, 24 million middle-class American families get a refund from the Internal Revenue Service.
Osborne’s assault on the British welfare state began with the universal child subsidy, a broad-base entitlement distributed to all families with children, regardless of their incomes.
The proportion is the same in France.
The Yom Kippur War in 1973 was a neat illustration of the Western and Soviet military influence.
Finally, the US no longer has a string of relatively stable clients in the region.
The Saudis made it clear in 2003 that they could no longer host US military installations.
And, despite hosting a huge US military base, Qatar maintains close links to Syria and Iran.
To this must now be added the revolt in Egypt.
The West will not find the resulting strategic terrain easy to navigate.
But this is different.
Individual ministers did their best.
It will not be easy.
I am a strong supporter of democracy.
When governments do not deliver, people protest.
And it moves very fast in precipitating crisis.
So what should the West do?
Any decision not to act is itself a decision of vast consequence.
At its crudest, the West cannot afford Egypt’s collapse.
The world cannot afford a nuclear-armed Iran.
March 11 is now Europe's version of September 11 in America.
In particular, the Franco-German "engine" of Europe should not be seen as a potential rival to the US.
Rather, the two countries form a laboratory needed for the internal working of the EU.
So I do not believe that a lasting rift looms.
Most Europeans see in America a strong friend.
We French are opposed to building a "two-speed" Europe.
The only way to arrest such fears is through closer and more frequent dialogue.
The Wild West of Electronic Waste
So is tantalum, the essential constituent of the capacitors used in cell phones.
But, along with the precious metals, e-waste also contains potent toxic chemicals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants.
Compounding this problem is the diversity of national and international regulatory policies in place or being developed to manage e-waste.
In the current global market, the life cycle of an electronic device may include the synthesis of labor and material from a dozen or more countries.
Some would manage e-waste at one of the handful of sophisticated smelters that can recover precious metals from discarded electronic devices.
Hence, this strategy will require some cross-border shipment of e-waste.
Will Programmers Rule?
NEW DELHI – Marc Andreessen made his first fortune writing the code that became Netscape Navigator, the Internet browser.
But will this solve the problem that he poses?
Perhaps not.
In this winner-take-all environment, only a small number of those who have taken programming courses will reap a majority of the rents.
Even though they are virtually indistinguishable in appearance, people seem to cherish the knowledge that someone has lovingly crafted their watch.
The Wolf that Ate Georgia
FLORENCE –In Phaedrus’s well-known fable of the wolf and the lamb, the wolf easily could have eaten the lamb without a word, but prefers to set out his “reasons.”
First, he scolds the lamb because he is muddying his drinking water (even though the wolf was upstream).
Then he argues that last year the lamb had called him bad names (but the lamb was only six months old).
The wolf’s “justifications” for his evil action were a luxury that he allowed himself.
None of these legal grounds holds water.
The Women of Europe’s Dream
LAUSANNE – I was born in 1945. My grandfather was a German Jew.
While such an outcome may be improbable, it would be complacent folly to dismiss the possibility.
I have not excluded men a priori in this exercise, but none occurred to me, and in any case the EU establishment has too many middle-aged white men as it is.
There has to be a cause.
This cannot be accomplished overnight.
The World after Bush
LONDON – There is a marvelous painting by Brueghel in the Brussels art gallery.
The British poet, W.H. Auden, was sufficiently impressed to write a poem about it.
The painting shows Icarus, his wings melted, plunging to a watery grave.
So President George W. Bush will go back to Crawford, Texas at the end of the year.
Consider four examples.
Moreover, Europe too often gives the impression that its citizens can be taken for granted.
But Europe cannot be built on this democratic deficit.
Welcome to the real world.
The world would also have seen why so many of us were rooting for her.
The World Cup and African Women
I grew up in Kenya, where my compatriots follow the English Premier League zealously, perhaps because of our colonial connection to England.
Kenyan women love soccer, too.
I’m a Chelsea fan, and so are most of my girlfriends.
Fortunately, Chelsea won.
At the tournament’s start, my girlfriends and I could not seem to agree on which team to support.
Should we pick from Algeria, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa, the countries representing Africa?
That we, young African women, are talking more about the sport is a sign of hope for women’s soccer on the continent.
But will the 2010 World Cup bring African women more than just fodder for gossip?
And, in 1999, the US hosted and won its second women’s World Cup, leading to a women’s soccer revolution in the country.
Will holding the world’s greatest single sporting event in Africa spark similar interest for the continent’s women?
FIFA has invited her to assist at the official World Cup opening ceremony.
Dludlu has been playing since the age of 10, and currently plies her trade at Tuks FC in Pretoria, where she is also studying at university.
Most African wives dread the season.
They become soccer widows, as their husbands flock to bars.
Every day at dinner, mothers are left alone to answer when children ask if daddy still lives in the house.  
Every season, he breaks at least one piece of furniture when his team loses.
She has changed her furniture at least twice since she got married four years ago.
That is because in most African countries, even men’s national teams are struggling.
Until brought to a level where they can compete in international tournaments beyond Africa, women’s soccer teams will continue to struggle.
A Global Platform for Global Issues
When the World Economic Forum was established in 1971, the global population was roughly four billion, of which 50% lived in poverty.
This is the world we live in; we each have a role to play.
Systems at Risk
Could something similar happen digitally, with a spark of misinformation igniting a conflagration and wreaking havoc before the truth is revealed?
Each case highlights the need to consider how to make systems more resilient, which means that systems cannot be considered in isolation.
The World’s Biggest Shock Absorber
From a German point of view, this discussion is a ludicrous inversion of the truth.
But this impression is deceptive, since the German state, through the built-in flexibility of its extensive social-welfare system, already contributes to stabilizing the world economy.
During the same period, annualized US imports declined by $284 billion more than US exports, and China’s annualized trade surplus increased by $249 billion.
The World\u0027s Runaway Train
The spectacular and historic global economic boom of the past six years is about to hit a wall.
Isn’t this obvious?
This time is different, though.
Yes, and that eventually happened with energy supplies in the 1980’s.
New York City, for example, has seen a reduction of perhaps 5% in private vehicles entering the city over the past six months.
Gridlock has abated, and you can almost get around the city by car these days.
But the response is slower elsewhere.
It certainly is not getting any easier to drive around in places like São Paulo, Dubai, and Shanghai.
The Global Growth Quest
And a final group rode China’s coattails.
In the process, inequality has risen further.
Simultaneous progress on both substance and process is needed.
Certainly, this seems to be the prevailing bet in the spin on global warming.
They have actually decreased by between 0.01 and 0.1°C per decade.
More importantly, we rarely hear that the Antarctic sea ice is not only not declining, but is above average for the past year.
But most models find results within the IPCC range of a sea-level increase of 18 to 59 centimeters (7-23 inches) this century.
Yet studies claiming one meter or more obviously make for better headlines.
But one-sided exaggeration is not the way forward.
Empty talk.
The rationale has nothing to do with an ethical foreign policy or with German and European interests.
The situation in Libya, we are told, is too dangerous; Germany’s government doesn’t want to get caught on a slippery slope and eventually have to commit ground troops in a civil war.
Libya is neither Afghanistan nor Iraq.
Like the Balkans, the far shores of the Mediterranean are part of the EU’s immediate security zone.
Unfortunately, you can forget about that.
That may be about to come to an end.
The Wrong Lesson of Munich
But that was not what many people thought at the time.
Britain and France could have stopped Germany.
So, what, exactly, has the world learned from Munich, 1938?
In the US, Munich has had a very different resonance.
During the Cold War, this was not a serious dilemma.
Europeans relied on NATO and the US to defend them in case of Soviet aggression.
The logic of the financial crisis is driving Europeans toward greater integration, which implies new mechanisms for political expression.
The two-party parliamentary model emerged in nineteenth-century Great Britain.
But what if not every little boy and girl is born that way?
In the stable British model, if a political party is too radical, it will lose the political center in the next election.
They were especially persuasive in Britain’s former colonies, notably in newly independent African states.
The old left-right polarity no longer works.
Europe today does not need inspirational leaders who can whip up a populist frenzy.
The Wrong Tax for Europe
CAMBRIDGE – Europe is already in pickle, so why not add more vinegar?
The United States gets only a fifth of its oil from the Persian Gulf.
Over a trillion barrels of reserves have been proven, and more are likely to be found.
Two-thirds of proven reserves are in the Persian Gulf, one of the world’s most volatile regions.
The US uses about 21 million barrels of oil a day, and imports about 2.5 million of it from the Persian Gulf.
Suppose there is a crisis in the Persian Gulf over Iran’s efforts to get nuclear weapons.
The world learned that lesson following the 1973 Arab-Israel war.
In short: more turmoil.&nbsp;
There is no way back to 2007.
The Year of the “China Model”
It will be China’s year in 2008.
And it is a real alternative.
For the model is non-Western, and the Chinese do not preach to others about democracy.
China’s appeal is growing in the Western world as well.
There is, however, a fly in the ointment.
Crises occur.
We should hope that they will live to see the day when the Chinese, too, will be a free people.
The Young General’s Old Tricks
And, no surprise, North Korea’s leaders also claim that what they propose to launch is a “peaceful” satellite.
It is clear that the rocket to be launched is effectively a long-range ballistic missile, which might be able to reach Guam, the site of an important US military base.
Moreover, 2012 is a special year for North Korea, starting with the 70th anniversary of Kim Jong-il’s birth on February 16.
For the commemoration of Kim Jong-il’s birthday in February, a kilogram of fish was provided to residents in one district, but nowhere else.
Creating a computer that "thinks" is one goal of artificial intelligence research.
(My computer is stuck.
(One of experimental psychology's most interesting findings is that people start to dream  before they fall asleep, while they are still physiologically awake.)
To understand color, it is not enough to understand red and yellow, or blue and violet.
It is therefore nonsense to believe that we can simulate thought on a computer without first understanding and simulating all of its component hues.
Dreaming, for example, is merely hallucinating while you sleep.
Different people have different "cognitive personalities."
(If we understood the physiological basis of mental focus, we would almost certainly have a better understanding about sleep disorders.) 
The answer must have something to do with the thought-spectrum.
Europe’s bad luck was to be hit with the worst financial crisis since the 1930’s while still only halfway through its integration process.
Consider what happens when banks in Texas, Florida, or California make bad lending decisions that threaten their survival.
So the real problem in Europe is not that Spain or Ireland has borrowed a lot, or that too much Spanish and Irish debt sits on banks balance sheets elsewhere in Europe.
The Roman Catholic Church has not moved away from its opposition to IVF.
Why not, for example, criticize Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, the Arkansas couple who recently had their 18th child?
But in countries where the Church’s influence remains strong, IVF’s opponents are fighting back.
This Recovery is Different
For Ireland and Spain, read Nevada and California (and, for Greece, read Puerto Rico).
PALO ALTO – Elections often turn on the state of the economy, especially in hard times.
Those on the right believe that governments’ top priority should be fiscal consolidation.
Yet somehow Brazil again became the World Cup champion.
University seminars in Rio are as lively as those in Cambridge, Mass or Cambridge U.K.
Three Cures for Three Crises
But the fall is larger.
Government is not the best form of organization of a financial system in the long term, and even in the short term it is not very good.
It is merely the best organization available.
Three Iraqs, Not One
What British imperial planners did was to stitch together three disparate provinces of the old Ottoman Empire and put at their head a prince from Hedjaz (now a part of Saudi Arabia).
Throwing such disparate groups into one body politic doomed the newly invented country to decades of strife and repression.
The old Ottoman Empire ruled these three provinces--as it ruled all of its imperial possessions--through its historically autocratic means.
A Shi'ite insurrection was brutally put down in the 1920's (with the help of the British Royal Air Force).
Nor is federation an alternative--as the terms of the federation itself become the bones of contention (see Bosnia or Cyprus).
During the Great Depression, matters were different.
Legislation such as the US Glass-Steagall Act clipped their wings.
Finally, Argentina stands in a category by itself.
But that is not to say America has no interest in the region.
The saving rate in China is the highest of any major country.
The difference between Chinese and US saving rates has been growing for decades.
Unfortunately, explaining saving rates is not an exact science.
In the US, one’s income is a dark secret that one might not reveal even to one’s own spouse.
If China was going to have its own Mikhail Gorbachev, it would have been Zhao.
They had to spend hours every day practicing the piano or violin.
Thus, she appears to view school plays as a waste of time that could be better spent studying or practicing music.
But it is also an important goal in its own right.
We, by contrast, are social animals.
So are elephants, and elephant mothers do not focus only on the well-being of their own offspring.
When it comes to raising our children, we need fewer tigers and more elephants.
The late twentieth century worked so well for Europeans.
In exchange for political solidarity, the US protected them and gave them the role of junior associates in running the world.
Attitudes formed in such congenial circumstances die hard.
But the problem is one of political psychology, not institutional arrangements.
They will not always agree among themselves.
Time for America to Turn South
Poll after poll shows that Latins feel more negatively about the US than at any time since the 1960's.
The list of problems facing Latin America is long, but the salient themes are easily distinguishable.
Why should the US bother?
First, and perhaps least self-evident, is energy.
Second, America has a strong security interest in the region.
Last year, I visited the main jumping-off point on the US-Mexican border: El Sasabe on the Sonora-Arizona border.
Bush or Kerry - both can deliver the foreign support.
Such an argument is not difficult to make.
Time for Politics in Kabul
Fiscal folly is widespread throughout Europe and much of the rest of the world.
Moreover, the problem is not just one of public debt.
Time to Fix the Euro
At the same time, the unfolding financial crisis has convincingly demonstrated the advantages of a common currency.
Time to Ratify New START
It will be particularly significant for Poland, a staunch ally of the US in NATO.
As a result, Polish-Russian relations have improved significantly over the last three years – no easy feat, given the burden of our shared history.
Poland supports ratification of this vitally important treaty.
The robust diplomatic approach that is needed to confront the problem must include three components.
On September 14, Swedish voters will vote on whether to join the Euro.
Today, a majority of Swedes appear likely to vote no.
To advocates of the Euro, this is a mystery.
The weak global economy, including moribund America, is part of the problem.
But with what?
Swedish voters seem likely to show similar wisdom.
To a Third Way Consensus
Nonetheless, these “third ways” share much:
Neo-liberal ideologies assume perfect markets, perfect information, and a host of other things, which even the best performing market economies cannot satisfy.
Long-term growth in East Asia has demonstrated that egalitarian policies aid growth.
But don’t be fooled!
Done mechanically, by ideology, they increase poverty and inequality, and stymie growth.
To A Ukrainian Spring
Where is our dignity?
We must apply our own talents and intellect, not wait for handouts from abroad.
They will be too busy thinking about themselves to worry about him or to cause trouble.
Ukraine needs and is ready for such a sign.
This is why he refrained from naming the political parties that support him after himself.
The third political force is the bloc which I lead.
We do not desire artificial recognition or flattering awards.
A ``Ukrainian Spring'' will surely come if we seize the moment!
To Err is Science
The vast majority of these initial research claims would yield only spurious findings.
But we should not panic.
Sometimes, this will be the best evidence we have.
Science is a noble pursuit, but genuine progress in scientific research is not easy to achieve.
Scientific knowledge is never final, but it evolves continuously.
But it would be a damaging to expect science to “show off” in this way.
Indeed, the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet entitled a recent book Democracy Against Itself.
I don’t think so.
Many people nowadays spend more of their lives watching television than they do in classrooms.
Or were they?
Outside Europe, the “anything goes” attitude was never fully accepted.
This is, to be sure, a special case.
But what if there actually is a fire?
But there is the other side to consider.
Violent responses to unwelcome views are never justified and cannot be accepted.
Self-censorship is worse than censorship itself, because it sacrifices freedom voluntarily.
It is also true that we do not have to buy any particular book or listen to an opera.
Thus, Idomeneo must be performed, and Salman Rushdie must be published.
On 16 October, 1962 President John F. Kennedy called together his closest advisors in the White House.
The film depicts what happened in the White House during those days.
Audio tapes from Kennedy's presidency aided in making the film.
Peter A. Almond, the film's producer also participated.
Theodore Sorensen summarized them in this way:
Kennedy acted as he did because NATO, other allies, and world opinion supported him;
When life and death issues are at stake, a leader can never let the media rush him into acting.
Nuclear pressures from Cuba would have made defense of Berlin more difficult, which was part of Khrushchev's strategy.
In the end, “the Berlin Crisis was solved through the outcome of the Cuban Missile Crisis," the historian Ernest May argued.
With nuclear proliferation, that risk may one day become real.
Today\u0027s Silk Road is Paved with Oil and Empires
America believes oil can grease the wheels of democracy, insuring independence.
Georgia and its president Eduard Shevarnadze are perhaps the most guilty of this.
Reality is quite different.
But although Russia's role in the region has decreased, cooperation with Russia is essential if the Transcaucasian states are to succeed.
This leaves us with an enduring mystery.
That proposal fell in two parts.
That was three elections ago.
Some of the motivations for this are purely human: he likes being Prime Minister and is good at it.
But that ambitious outcome is easier described than achieved.
Any Palestinian state should be within the 1967 borders (as adjusted through negotiation).
Peace activists on both sides solved that in the Geneva initiative.
His greatest achievement was the peace deal in Northern Ireland.
Why should what worked in Northern Ireland – indeed, what was pressed on Britain by the United States – be unthinkable in the Middle East?
I abhor any and every terrorist act, by Hamas or anyone else.
A Palestinian state will need to be built from the bottom up.
And what is built should not be destroyed.
So why did Blair support it?
It is uncertain whether Tony Blair could have dissuaded George Bush from waging war in Iraq.
Too Big to Jail
Even the terminology used to frame the discussion is wrong.
But nothing could be further from the truth.
Top bankers want to make a lot of money.
They also want to stay out of prison.
The message to bank executives today is simple: build your bank to be as big as possible – and then keep growing.
If you manage to become big enough, you and your employees are not just too big to fail, but also too big to jail.
Too Big to Reform?
It was a time when the tectonic plates of the financial system seemed to be shifting beneath us.
But it has no formal authority to mandate a common approach to capital (the G-20 should give it one).
The British government did the same, acting as midwife to the Lloyds-Halifax Bank of Scotland combine, now widely seen to have been a major error.
Where do I stand in this lively debate?
A regulator-designed banking system would make that aim more difficult to achieve.
Too European to Fail
For some time now, Greek ten-year government-bond yields have been about 300 basis points above German yields.
So none of the countries at risk would seriously consider reintroducing a national currency.
Together with the International Monetary Fund’s contribution, the EU loan to Latvia amounts to more than 33% of Latvian GDP.
One option is for large EU countries to construct a bailout package.
Too Much “Too Big to Fail”?
Too Much Information
But that doesn’t mean that all leaks should be condemned.
None of this improves policymaking.
The policy response to the slowdown in investment differs across countries.
Once again, all the formulas for Western-type democracy depend on the will of an enlightened and benevolent czar.
To all of this, Putin never once said “boo.”
Toppling the Arab Berlin Wall
But what will replace it?
But they will first have to make a conscious decision to accept Jordan as their home.
Iran, however, does not have this luxury.
But indigenous reform in the Middle East is only half the battle.
The other half is bringing peace to Palestinians and Israelis.
I completed the US Army's three-month basic interrogation course in the late 1980's, after studying Russian at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California.
Unfortunately, like "applying pressure," the Geneva conventions were never defined.
Toward an Atlantic Divorce?
One is the extent to which North America’s center of gravity is shifting westwards.
California long ago overtook New York as the most populous US state.
Silicon Valley and Microsoft are both on the West Coast.
And China, is, for the US, both its greatest opportunity as a market and its greatest potential superpower rival.
But a number of are.
The byline read: "Faire l'Europe c'est faire le poids" (To build Europe is to give us weight).
Many advocates of the euro wish to see it rival the dollar as an international reserve currency.
EU members have many interests in common.
Most sensitive of all is the future of military relations between Europe and North America.
As a result of an initiative by the UK Government, the WEU is to be absorbed into the EU.
Other agreements refer to building an autonomous European defence capability.
That glue has dissolved.
I agree.
Kosovo is one example.
What if they found themselves backing opposing combatants?
Without such efforts, the Atlantic Partnership, at the moment of its greatest prosperity, may be doomed to drift and divorce.
Towards a French Sixth Republic?
An expert council will send him its proposals by November 1.
Only the Third Republic (1875-1940) lasted longer than the current Fifth Republic.
Established quickly in 1958 by de Gaulle in the midst of the Algerian crisis, tthe institutions of the Fifth Republic came under fire from the very first day.
Does this mean that a Sixth Republic is inevitable?
Towards a Green Nanotechnology
Will nanotechnology be different?
The production, use, and disposal of nanomaterials will inevitably lead to their appearance in air, water, soils, or organisms.
But processes that may lead to the breakdown of nanomaterials, including degradation by bacteria, are virtually unexplored. 
Indeed, many of the ingredients used to make nanomaterials are currently known to present risks to human health.
It would be naïve to imagine that nanotechnology will evolve without risks to our health and environment.
Environmentally safe nanotechnology will come at a cost in time, money, and political capital.
When it comes to the economy, Putin is a clean slate upon which his entourage – the clans of Berezovsky and Chubais – will write.
This control is ostensibly democratic – the "Kremlin bloc" of parties holds a majority of votes.
Towards a Wider Europe
The Wider Europe Initiative is meant to help develop those attributes.
There is a fundamental difference between the EU's Eastern and Southern flanks.
I established Open Society Foundations in all the countries of the former Soviet Union.
A civil society component must be included in every action plan.
By 2040 three of the world’s five largest economies – China, India, and Japan – will be in Asia.
That is one side of the Asian picture.
But free trade is a two-way street.
Europe must become a stakeholder in Asia if both sides are to gain maximum benefit from cooperation and help shape the world of the future.
By the same token, the new Asian players must take into account the progress achieved in this regard in the latter half of the twentieth century.
Toxic Tests
But, if the results of such tests are to be reliable, they should avoid the US tests’ fundamental flaw.
Not at all.
Democracy is supposedly on the march in the Middle East.
Qatar and Oman have elected consultative councils and enfranchised women.
The government describes this as a “new political era.”
Would it be elected?
Currently, the King appoints its members.
The King proposes, they discuss.
MILAN – The global economy is experiencing a major growth challenge.
But the challenges across countries are not the same.
The US sovereign-debt market shows no similar evidence of having reached a limit yet.
But, for individual economies, relative productivity versus income levels determines the share of global tradable aggregate demand that is accessible.
Trade and the Third World
So consider in this light India's three demands.
India's average tariff rate is around 30%.
Postscript: Fortunately, not all North-South engagements are politically charged.
Some years ago I left Delhi to lecture in a city in the developing world.
Trading In Hate
This is not new.
Yet, like a desert cactus, hate can thrive on very little.
In fact, in a highly competitive world, Hewlett-Packard managed to save 150,000 jobs by sacrificing those 30,000.
Groups calling themselves “dot-busters” have attacked Indian women.
Much of the world expected more elevated behavior from Obama.
Trading Our Way Out of Crisis
Since the crisis began, export earnings of the world’s poorest countries are down $26.8 billion, or 44%.
Consider United States-China trade in iPods.
Clearly, the words “made in” mean something very different from what they meant 20 years ago.
That is the central aim of the Aid for Trade initiative.
Whether or not developing countries benefited was of little concern.
But this issue too is not on the agenda.
This, too, should be a high priority of a true development round.
Since then, stability and hope have begun to return to a region affected by the destruction of war and the widespread despair of social displacement.
In the Mediterranean countries of North Africa, the young active population is expanding fast.
Since 1990, this region's population has grown by 24%, to 167.2 million.
Yet one in every three young people is unemployed.
This joblessness naturally makes the EU a magnet for migrant labor.
Its development is often neglected.

She has written a manifesto about breaking the glass ceiling, called Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, and is drawing fire for it, because she argues that women often sabotage themselves.
My own view is that there is nothing wrong with some same-sex gatherings in a private setting, whereas in public contexts, discrimination is discrimination.
Sandberg will have to explain her position on this issue.
Transforming Science Education
Mathematics, the foundation for all science, depends on its concise language and logical ordering.
This sequence of study was devised in 1893.
I believe that it is obsolete, pedagogically disastrous, and ignores the tremendous scientific advances of the twentieth century.
Studying science should begin with physics, not biology.
In studying physics, students study algebra simultaneously, motivating them with a sense of the power of mathematics.
At all stages of the science curriculum, basic questions must be asked.
How does something work?
Teachers need time to talk together.
Transition in Crisis?
That deep integration cuts both ways.
Further east, resource-rich transition economies such as Russia and Kazakhstan are facing what is arguably an even bigger challenge.
Trapped on the Right
As a result, William Hague, the Tory leader, shifted his party further to the right.
The difference is that George W. Bush won the presidency by a whisker, whereas William Hague could not avoid defeat.
Indeed, the Euro has been one of the main instruments in moving Europe’s center-left parties onto the middle ground, or even to the center-right.
But the response of some center-right parties in Europe has been to move further right, specifically in an anti-Europe or nationalistic direction.
He, like William Hague and George W Bush, is promising to slash taxes.
Treason in the Air
He argues that we need “more people chaining themselves to coal plants,” a point repeated by Gore.
Indeed, nobody emits CO2 for fun.
Treating Al-Qaeda
Since 2003, Prince Muhammad has been in charge of a successful campaign against violent Islamism in the Kingdom.
How can you pretend to be acting to change the world if you no longer understand it?
Tribes versus Terrorists
How can you have victory here?”
But seven years later, what has the US achieved?
That’s where they are.
That’s where it will come from.
It has little contact or communication with its people and leaders.
But there is a way to do so.
The British moved some members of the tribes from the unsettled areas of the frontier to the settled (colonial) areas.
These organizations work with the people to assess their needs and then build the institutions to deliver care.
This is not the first time communications has been a problem for the ECB.
“Inflation targeting” also means the central bank follows certain specified rules.
Trick or Treat?
Old-fashioned paternalists have always been very well aware of this.
Libertarian paternalists are different.
Indeed, sometimes it leads to results that are inefficient, “nasty,” or both.
If this is the case, who is to decide in what areas individuals can be fairly nudged by social engineers?
Tropics of Cancer?
Indeed, by the end of this decade, about 150 million people worldwide will have cancer, with approximately 60% of them residing in developing countries.
As Chan and Amano point out:
And acetic acid can be used to visualize cervical cancers, which can then be treated with cryotherapy (freezing).
The 1980’s was the last time anyone tried this sort of intervention.
The high water mark of intervention came a few years later, between the Plaza meeting of finance ministers in September 1985 and the Louvre meeting in February 1987.
The Louvre agreement was not just ineffective.
But the problem is that the world’s central banks do not sing from the same hymnbook.
The bankers will laugh, while politicians wail and gnash their teeth.
He returned to power two days later because of his opponents' mistakes.
They would seek to block him, especially through their control of the media.
Smelling blood, business and labor leaders called for a national strike to support the company.
After announcing that the president had resigned, they charged Pedro Carmona, head of the businessmen's federation, with forming a government.
It is true that possessing does not mean using; that for 15 years the world has had eight nuclear powers; and that nuclear force has not been used since 1945.
The West’s aim, announced by the US and followed by the triad, is to force Iran to give up uranium enrichment.
Nor has the Iranian government ever publicly expressed a will to possess nuclear weapons.
Refocusing Medical Research
But blaming drug companies is too easy a response.
Turkey, Armenia, and the Burden of Memory
It is estimated that 1.5 million people perished.
The European Parliament is pressing for Turkish recognition of the Armenian genocide.
This is not healthy for the development of Armenia’s democracy and weak economy.
Turkey, Europe and Middle-East Security
Yet Turkey is also succeeding in keeping an equal distance between both the EU and the US.
Turkey’s posture – looking both East and West – is neither paradoxical nor inconsistent.
Turkey is thus capable of overcoming the dichotomies of East-West, Europe-Middle East, and North-South.
This geography is Turkey’s natural historical and cultural hinterland.
As a result, we stand firmly opposed to discrimination against any society, religion, sect, culture, or country.
When my party took office in 2002, the Turkish economy totaled around $250 billion.
Turkey and the IMF
CAMBRIDGE: Without warning, Turkey dove into financial crisis.
Ever since the Asian crisis of 1997 the IMF’s policies have been under attack.
With so much tinder around, it is surprising that a wildfire did not start before now.
A Turkish bank saw a Romanian subsidiary go bankrupt. A run on the Turkish bank followed.
Indeed, Argentina is one of the last countries with such an arrangement and it is in the IMF emergency room.
The IMF is to be congratulated for understanding that the exchange rate is not the solution to every problem.
Turkey on Trial
If Turkey’s ongoing political-military trials ever find their way to the screen, there will be no shortage of such denouements.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan promotes the trials as evidence of Turkey’s new turn towards democracy and the rule of law.
The cases are comical – or would be if they were not really happening in a country of 74 million people whose strategic importance is difficult to overstate.
Others appear to have misspelled their own names or gotten their titles wrong.
Two forensic reports have established that the handwriting on the incriminating CD was forged.
Can you explain how my client could have known the names of officers on a frigate that joined the Navy only in 2005?
Or the license plate on a vehicle that was issued in 2006?”
The judge brings down his gavel with a loud thump.
The case is dismissed.
The charges again rest on electronic files, supposedly found in the defendants’ homes.
Similar examples abound in other cases.
A journalist is jailed because his notes for an unfinished manuscript on the Gülen movement are construed as instructions from a terrorist organization.
Turkey Plays the European Card
Iranian officials went so far as to warn Turkey that it would make the Malatya facility its first target in retaliation for a Western strike on Iran.
Iran’s threat, therefore, is an expression more of discontent with Turkey than of genuine concern that the Malatya facility will adversely affect its deterrent capacity.
Turkey’s Choice
A number of independents will complete the legislative roster.
But not completely.
First, what does the AKP want?
The president names the head of the armed forces, a power that could potentially turn the military into a servant of the government.
But what precisely would that model be?
Self-censorship has become routine.
Even the Turkish Academy of Sciences has been targeted.
These trials are, in fact, often staged to serve Gülenist ends specifically.
For Turkey’s friends abroad, it is time for some tough love.
It wasn’t long ago that Turkey appeared to be a bright beacon of democracy and moderation in a region accustomed to autocracy and radicalism.
Turkey\u0027s Final Act?
All are symptoms of Turkey's perverted politics.
In haste, the IMF arrived on the scene, waving $10 billion at the problem.
Not quite, because interest rates remained high and creditors remained alarmed.
The precariousness of the situation called for early and dramatic declines in interest rates driven by an early restoration in confidence.
By not dealing with it!
What could avoid this?
Yet recent developments suggest that, if this policy is pushed to its limits, it stumbles on its own premises.
The region’s people are sliding into enemy camps, deepening their societies’ wounds in the process.
ISTANBUL – Just a few years ago, Europe headed Turkey’s agenda.
As a result, formal and informal links between the new Turkish political élite and the Arab world have been easier to forge.
Turkey\u0027s Modern, Muslim Face
At the same time, Turkey hosted a two-day "dialogue of civilizations" last February between the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the European Union.
Participants from both sides found common cause expressing their doubts about American policies.
Turkey’s Nation of Faiths
For the first time in the Republic’s history, 365 landholdings and buildings belonging to the minority communities were legally registered under their name.
Then, in August 2011, an important amendment to the Associations law mandated the return of more than 350 properties to religious minorities.
Even before that, in November 2010, the Greek-Orthodox Orphanage on Halki Island was returned to the Greek-Orthodox Patriarchy.
In order to facilitate their religious duties, the Orthodox metropolitans were granted Turkish citizenship.
The Ministry of Culture and Tourism has renovated the Panagia Sümela Monastery, a 1,600-year-old church in Trabzon on the Black Sea coast.
Quite simply, we stopped viewing our geography and history as a curse or disadvantage.
Turkey’s New Mission
From now on, it can only be complementary to such a peace.
Erdoğan’s Kurdish Gambit
ISTANBUL – Conflict in the Middle East threatens not only the security of many of its states, but also their continued existence.
A recently leaked account of Ocalan’s strategy highlights the risk, for it cites the PKK leader as threatening the government with full-scale war.
But it is the incipient energy deal between Turkey and the KRG that is set to build the foundation for a real strategic alliance.
For the KRG, the deal would secure the region’s future economic wealth without holding it hostage to an increasingly unsympathetic Iraqi government.
But the distribution of proceeds from hydrocarbons is irregular, and the central government has accumulated significant arrears.
But now they are quite different.
Here, too, no such restrictions exist in France.
France is at the high end of the EU norm, with a score of six.
If the constitutional court will not stop a potential AKP-led imposition of Sharia, who will?
Turkey is now a major player in its own right, in the Middle East and far beyond.
Yet Turkey’s “distinctiveness” in the Middle East is not necessarily detrimental to the West.
This is exactly what Turkey had been doing in its relations with the ex-Soviet world since the 1990’s without attracting much attention from the West.
But Turkish democracy itself is not yet consolidated, and this is a precondition for Turkish foreign policy to become an asset for the EU and the US.
The Obama administration’s approach to Turkey has been constructive.
The EU’s role is even more critical.
Turkey’s Transformation
PKK guerrilla attacks have resulted in more than 35,000 deaths since l984.
Turkey to the EU’s Rescue
Indeed, when the accord was reached, the EU was not even in the room.
So what is the EU left with?
Its know-it-all attitude grates almost everywhere.
Europeans do not realize how little interest in “European affairs” there is in Seoul, Sydney, São Paolo, or San Francisco.
The debate about whether Turkey is European is absurd.
In a highly complex and diverse world, the EU stands out for its homogeneity.
There is more ethnic diversity in, say, Malaysia than in the entire EU.
Ending the Syrian Horror
Saudi Arabia is doing what it can to help.
Turkmenistan’s Tentative Opening
The world needs to welcome this possibility and back his efforts.
Niyazov forced students, from grammar school to the post-graduate level, to make his idiosyncratic book, the Ruhnama , the primary focus of their studies.
Progress is slow.
Educational reform could be the first step in an evolutionary process of significant change.
Turning North Korea Around
Talk of a “grand bargain” remains just that – talk.
Today, North Korea is a de-industrializing, near-subsistence economy.
Moreover, North Korea is actively courting foreign investment.
Moreover, the Academy of Science established a group of leading scientists, who were immediately dispatched to the Chernobyl region.
This would be in the spirit of the Glasnost policy that was by then already established in the Soviet Union.
My declaration of January 15, 1986, is well known around the world.
According to scientific experts, one SS-18 rocket could contain a hundred Chernobyls.
We should also start seriously working on the production of the alternative sources of energy.
This will be one of the EBRD’s strategic priorities in 2010.
Turning the Page in Mexico
In the long run, the answer undoubtedly lies in the transformation of the Mexican left, and partly also of the Mexican right.
That epoch came to an end in 2000, and will not return.
Not only is it not New Labor; it is not even like the French, Spanish, or Chilean Socialist Parties, or Brazil’s Workers’ Party.
It is time for Mexico to turn the page, but it must turn the right page.
Twitter, which lets people send bite-size messages to large groups, allows Chinese to quickly disseminate urgent news or even uncomfortable facts.
In November, citizen protests against the construction of an incinerator in Guangzhou became a widely Tweeted event.
The most flagrant confusion is that which conflates state and nation.
When social organizations are strong, conflict arises to control public resources.
Twenty-Five Years of HIV/AIDS
It is now a quarter-century since the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was recognized.
With 4.3 million new HIV infections each year throughout the world, we face an untenable situation, as new HIV infections far outstrip our ability to treat all those infected.
So improvements in our ability to prevent HIV infections from occurring are desperately needed.
We also know that the body’s natural immune response against HIV is inadequate in containing or controlling the virus.
But our ultimate goal is to develop a vaccine that can prevent HIV infection.
To succeed, we must solve the mystery of how to induce the human body to produce a protective immune response.
Twenty Years After the Wall
At that moment, peace between Palestinians and Israelis could have been achieved, and thus a new beginning made in the Middle East.
Europe – and, within it, Germany – were among the big winners of November 9, 1989.
The Continent reunited in liberty: Germany on October 3, 1990; Europe with the great European Union enlargement of May 1, 2004.
Europe has made only insufficient use of its opportunities since 1989 – and could dramatically lose influence in the emerging power structure of the twenty-first century.
The real winners of this new world order are the large emerging countries, first and foremost China and India, which increasingly set the pace of global economic and political development.
Twenty years after Berlin, Copenhagen is calling.
Once again Pope John Paul II has returned to hospital, gravely ill.
The picture that emerges is one of a mixture of colors.
Before and after his election, the then Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Krakow was its most effective representative.
Cardinal Wojtyla’s election as Pope therefore had a significance far beyond the confines of the Church.
Actually he himself did not like the identification of his church with civil society.
In a conversation he protested: “No, the Church is not civil society, it is sacred society.”
He was the counterpoint to Pope John XXIII, who, through the Second Vatican Council of the 1960’s and in numerous other ways, tried to reconcile Catholics with the modern age.
Pope John Paul arrested this process and even tried to reverse it.
Paradoxically, he found it easier to reach out to non-Christian religions.
The Catholic-Jewish dialogue in particular was in good hands with him.
Has he been a man of peace?
There was little he could do in Kosovo or the Congo.
This was all the more relevant to the extent that Pope John Paul II is not enamored with the United States.
Pope John Paul II is in many ways an intellectual; he may have been underrated in that regard.
He bore his suffering since the assassination attempt of 1981 with dignity.
Does anyone remember that after his re-election Bush promised to reform the pension system (“Social Security”)?
Can it be the same President Oscar Arias who (barely) won the recent presidential election in Costa Rica and now returns to power after 20 years?
And was not Silvio Berlusconi’s candidate for the presidency of the Italian Senate, Giulio Andreotti, a junior member of one of Italy’s first post-1945 governments?
Two and a Half Cheers for the Mediterranean Union
It would have been in essence a French-run enterprise that the rest of Europe would have paid for.
This did not go down well, particularly with the Germans.
The original Barcelona Process, launched in 1995, was an excellent scheme.
There was some co-operation on common problems like drugs and illegal immigration.
Of course, the status of capitalists will improve once the "Three Represents" is implemented.
Most, however, run mom-and-pop businesses in fiercely competitive sectors.
China's biggest private firm, the Hope Group, is located in Sichuan and started in the animal feed business.
Many, as everywhere else in the world, fail on the way.
Capitalists control wealth and wealth creation.
Two Cheers for the Rhineland Model
Today, few people - if any - refer to the Rhineland model with such satisfaction.
Some may never have been viable.
This is true for health care.
Overseas owners were less than understanding of the German custom of paying a thirteenth monthly salary at Christmas.
Does this mean the end of the Rhineland model?
Still, constructing a welfare state fit for new economic conditions is a task that must be undertaken.
No one has yet managed this process, not even the Anglo Saxons.
It is possible - indeed, likely - that modern service-based economies will look very different in the Rhineland, Southeast England, Lombardy, and the Île-de-France.
So there is no reason for despair in the Rhineland - or for gloating by the enemies of its economic model.
Two Decades from Warsaw
Within a year, Polish workers were striking for the right to establish independent trade unions, staging two weeks of sit-ins at state-owned factories to achieve their goal.
Karl Marx would have been proud of them, but it was the Pope’s portrait that hung on the gate of Gdansk’s Lenin Shipyard during the strike.
The movement united ten million people: workers and professors, peasants and students, priests and freethinkers among them – all of civil society.
Hundreds of books prohibited by Communist censors (for example, Gunther Grass’s The Tin Drum ) came to light.
The haggling continued from February until April 1989.
But the key point was that the party’s monopoly on power was jettisoned.
The road to democracy was open.
It was impossible to form a government without its participation.
A hangman’s noose did not await them.
By 1989’s end, the post-Yalta Europe was free.
This target has become a veritable commandment of campaigners since the EU embraced it in 1996.
This is an inherently political process.
Ideally, the number should be zero.
This is simply incorrect: the IPCC’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning scientists are “policy neutral.”
But this interpretation is flatly wrong.
But we don’t actually do that.
But confusing political campaigning with scientific reason won’t help.
Like an off-road rally through a mountainous desert, it promises excitement and fierce competition.
Technological innovation provides the excitement.
After 2015, easily accessible supplies of oil and gas probably will no longer keep up with demand.
The use of local coal and homegrown biofuels increases fast.
National governments introduce efficiency standards, taxes, and other policy instruments to improve the environmental performance of buildings, vehicles, and transport fuels.
For a second opinion, we appealed to climate change calculations made at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Today, none capture CO2.
Companies can suggest possible routes to get there, but governments are in the driver’s seat.
I suppose it was the 50th anniversary of the so-called “kitchen debate” which he held with Richard Nixon that first triggered my memories.
The year 1956 was the best of times and the worst of times for Khrushchev.
Hungary, of course, had its short and glorious revolution.
So the Red Army invaded Hungary – on a scale larger than the Allies’ D-Day invasion of Europe in 1944.
Two Nightmare Scenarios
Europe’s Two-Speed Future
This can be accomplished in two ways.
In addition, Article 138 would allow unified representation of the eurozone in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
More than a hundred thousand people remain displaced by the accident, some having lost family, homes, possessions, and even the desire to live.
Closely associated with the challenge of optimizing remediation is that of understanding how contaminants will behave as a result of natural processes.
The agreement could become a model for similar agreements with other countries belonging to the EU’s Eastern Partnership.
Such an acknowledgement could be seen as formal recognition of the fact that membership of the EU remains a long-term option for Ukraine.
Indeed, the country could develop into a mini-China, placing massive manufacturing capacity immediately adjacent to the global economy’s largest integrated market.
Newly elected as leader of the Kadima party, Livni only barely defeated her rival, Shaul Mofaz.
It should respectfully leave the rabbis and the army officers in their confined quarters.
Israel’s excellent judiciary can rely on her full support.
Nor, for that matter, is her Hebrew.
Here is an Israel that you may not recognize, especially if the electronic media is your window on the world.
After all, Israel is not the United States, and gender can never work as anyone’s sole adjective.
Even if she persists, she may break her teeth on the same bones of contention that kept her predecessors from achieving security and peace.
Uganda’s Smart Protectionism
New mills, meanwhile, lowered the cost of bringing domestic rice to market, so that consumers now still pay about the same for rice as they always have.
As more Africans move to cities, they acquire a taste for rice, which is easy to store and can be cooked quickly.
Indeed, African governments might wish to look selectively at other crops.
Ukraine, Russia, and European Stability
They are good words that need to be defended.
He has a big responsibility not to start one.
It has shown that it can defeat Georgia’s army.
Now we have Georgia.
Risk premia in Russia have skyrocketed.
Here, Ukraine, with its eight million ethnic Russians – many of them in Crimea – is key.
Nor does Ukraine’s relationship with NATO pose a threat to Russia.
The Russian invasion of Georgia has sent shock waves throughout the West and the former Soviet space - especially Ukraine.
Georgia's increasingly pro-Western course, including growing ties to NATO, has been a thorn in Moscow's side.
But it did not pose a serious threat to Russian security.
One is energy.
Under an agreement signed in 1997, Ukraine granted Russia basing rights for the fleet at Sevastopol in Crimea until 2017.
Ukraine has been pressing Russia to begin discussions on the fleet's withdrawal.
But Russia has dragged its feet, suggesting that Moscow may seek to use the presence of the fleet as a means of pressuring Ukraine.
Poking an angry bear is not a wise policy.
Ukraine Loses Its Way
Instead, Ukraine’s president is now increasingly consolidating his total control over the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary.
Endemic corruption.
One signpost points towards democracy; the other towards autocracy.
Millions of Ukraine’s citizens favor EU membership, but their enthusiasm is tempered by the absence of a clear EU policy towards Ukraine.
Why should people outside of Ukraine care?
A strong, prosperous Ukraine would make the whole region east of the Elbe look different.
The cause of this situation is clear.
Independent, too, of global opinion, which long ago eliminated him from the list of respectable politicians.
These threats make it certain that lies are printed and broadcast - lies that are the backbone of Kuchma's regime.
The majority of voters supported parties that opposed President Kuchma.
But the president manipulated Ukraine's parliamentary procedures to continue his policies of divide and misrule.
Even though the oligarchs control all but one of the main television stations, he remains popular.
The general election called for May 27 will help to keep things this way.
Yugoslavia is but a miniature version of what might happen in Ukraine if Yanukovich’s tactics are allowed to bring ethnic antagonisms to the boiling point.
Ukraine’s unity, however, is not artificial.
Our people understand that the Yanukovich government is not just political poison.
KYIV – Inflation in Ukraine is skyrocketing.
By March, it reached 26% per year and continues to rise.
But this is false.
But the NBU refused to do so – making Ukraine the last country in Central and Eastern Europe to tie its currency to the dollar. 
Time is short.
They did not.
Newspapers and broadcasts were packed with lies.
But Ukrainians have now given their seal of approval to democracy and an open society.
The joy of opposition is its simplicity; Ukrainians understood what we opposed and stood side by side with us.
Yes, Ukraine has Ukrainian speakers and it has Russian speakers; yes, it has Orthodox and Catholics.
Our nation’s unity is not artificial.
Having laid the foundations of genuine democracy, our house will not be divided by anyone.
In renewing our liberties, we will renew our unity.
We will renew Ukraine.
Ukraine’s Own Goal
Official taxes are high when spending is high.
There were uniform rules and equal protection for everyone.
Ukraine\u0027s Road to Europe
"East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet," Rudyard Kipling famously said.
Ukraine may undoubtedly be of the East, but it is the East of Europe.
Yet, as the results of the parliamentary elections held on March 31 demonstrate, Ukrainians remain determined to travel that road.
I am a social democrat who was never a Communist party member, though I achieved success as a lawyer in Soviet times.
I recognize that our Soviet "heritage" accounts for much of the hardship Ukraine faced in seeking its European vocation.
But our Soviet heritage does not excuse everything.
You can see that on the streets and squares of Kiev.
Young people learn English, German, French; they study computers and suft the web in internet cafes.
Now their functioning has become more or less normal.
Taming our radicals, and the radical impulse, has not been easy.
For too long Ukraine was a province of the USSR and Tsarist empire; the most important one, of course, but still a province.
Feeling ourselves outcasts or at least on the margins of Europe, we seek to build a society without outsiders or outcasts.
Ukraine’s Struggle for Law
For there is such a thing as a lawless legality.
Ministers may not. Parliament may not.
Majorities may not.
Individuals may not. Crowds may not.
Yet these are the choices offered by our influential doctrinaires.
No human obstruction can long withstand it.
Achieve it we will.
Ukraine’s Watershed Election
Ukraine’s politics are not those of the steppe.
Elections are seldom make-or-break affairs.
Ukrainian Democracy and Its Cynics
He was back in prison three years later, convicted of manslaughter.
Of course, Tymoshenko is no saint.
One year later, Ukraine’s economy is turning around.
German exports to China accounted for only 0.3% of the country’s GDP in 2005, but stood at 1.4% of GDP in 2008.
Political impediments often enable lax arrangements to linger even after they are recognized as inefficient.
The group that, in normal times, can be expected to have the most influence is that which consists of insiders within publicly-traded companies.
This opportunity should not be missed.
This is not a trivial question.
Perhaps the answer lies in human psychology.
Job tenure may also serve as a form of social security, because the government performs miserably on providing a safety net and private insurance markets do not exist.
Change is not easy.
Protected workers have no reason to give up their benefits.
The view expressed here are the author’s own.
Understanding Global Competitiveness
Public institutions refer to the quality of governance.
Is there widespread corruption?
Corruption is deemed nearly non-existent in these countries.
This proportion is now around 80% of students in Canada and the US.
Thus they do not formally give up anything.
Such a pattern is a formula for endless conflict and endless defeat.
Yet defeats do not force new attitudes, policies, or leaders.
The pragmatic “lesson” remains unlearned because those who take this view perceive a different lesson.
Formal ceasefires or political solutions are inconceivable.
At the same time, the conflict gives them money, power, and glory.
Ideally, Lebanon’s army and government would enter the area and run it as part of their country.
Understanding the Frankenstein Tradition
The new genetic information “rebooted” its host cell and got it to function, replicate, and take on the characteristics of the “donor.”
In other words, a sort of synthetic organism had been created.
The former is more apt: Venter’s creation is evolutionary, not revolutionary.
Similar to the 1967 experiments, the infectious RNA was synthesized enzymatically.
It was able to direct the synthesis of viral proteins in the absence of a natural template.
But some of the hype that surrounded the publication of the ensuing article in the journal Nature was disproportionate.amp#160;
The Debt-Growth Controversy
The Reinhart/Rogoff paper is just a small part of a voluminous academic literature that shows high debt levels to be economically risky.
Corroborating statistical evidence shows that high deficits and debt increase long-run interest rates.
UNESCO for Sale
Perhaps the recipients will love Obiang, too.
Free and fair elections do not exist.
My nieces and nephews have a life expectancy of 52 years.
My nieces and nephews in Equatorial Guinea still go to school on an empty stomach.
Surviving on less than a dollar a day, as most of my countrymen do, means living without running water, sanitation, or electricity.
UNESCO remains unabashed.
Or maybe they love Obiang’s money more than they love my nieces and nephews.
For some, low prices would render them insolvent.
Unfreezing Europe\u0027s Northern Dimension
COPENHAGEN: Slowly, ever so slowly, Europe is establishing its new political geography.
So 2001 can be a crucial year in the never-ending story of the creation of a new and better Europe.
Think of the Kaliningrad-oblast. With Lithuania's independence it was cut off by land from Russia.
But EU-enlargement alone will not do the trick.
Then came years of Cold War division. Half of the Baltic Sea became an economic dead sea.
Indeed, Immanuel Kant's old imperative - that trade is peace-making - should not be forgotten.
Special resonance is added to this thought by the fact that Kant himself was born in what used to be K”nigsberg, now Russia's Kaliningrad.
First, it must be understood that the EU and the US start from very different points in the race to reduce emissions.
British energy policy also shifted around that time, from reliance on coal to use of natural gas from the North Sea.
The problem is not merely one of competitiveness for European and American companies.
Like other countries, US should occasionally use unilateral tactics.
For example, the "New International Information Order" proposed by UNESCO in the 1970s would have helped authoritarian governments restrict freedom of the press.
The US is the largest source of greenhouse gases, but three quarters of the sources originate outside its borders.
Without cooperation, the problem is beyond American control.
Even militarily, the US should rarely intervene alone.
Uniting Asia
This is why it needs a concert of powers to sustain its fragile stability.
Uniting Europe’s Fleets
Europe’s maritime-security strategy has long been founded on two key tenets.
International events highlight these priorities’ relevance.
Unity is Not Enough
Universities: Renaissance or Decay?
Lambert and Butler identify four main weaknesses of European universities that must be addressed.
Even more jobs are somewhere between the two.
One of the greatest comparative strengths of American universities lies in the nature of human relations.
Teachers take their job seriously.
The price of farmland hasn’t grown so fast as to make investors rich.
Europe’s Hidden Stimulus
Governments often become enamored of innovative sectors, such as semiconductors, that account for only a very small share of total investment.
Unmasking the Man with the Wooden Face
Deng, in effect, personally designated Hu as successor to President Jiang Zemin.
The leadership seemed to be moving away from the ancien regime of Jiang.
Hu is due to remain in power until 2012.
Was this due to a lack of openness or imagination on our part, or a lack of interest or goodwill on Russia’s part?
Besides, what would a containment policy applied to Russia today look like?
A fine line must be drawn in defining Western policy towards Russia.
Clearing A Path Through the Brain
How close are we to that goal?
A very dense network of processes occupies the space between the cell bodies of the neurons, neuroglia (cells that support and protect neurons), and blood vessels.
Likewise, not all electrical transmission is mediated by gap junctions, and these forms involve different specialized structures.
In addition, electrical interactions take place between closely apposed neuronal elements without obvious membrane specializations.
Furthermore, it has been proposed that glial cells are involved in information processing through their bi-directional signaling with neurons.
The modulatory systems, however, act on multiple neuronal circuits and brain areas.
Nevertheless, even using this technology, full reconstruction of whole brains is possible only for relatively simple nervous systems.
If we succeed, we will finally be able to see the forest – without having to look for every tree.
LONDON – Is there more to be said about Egypt?
Freedom of expression is in their bones; mass protests their visual lifeblood.
Most Western leaders think naturally in terms of a “transition to democracy.”
In the short run, of course, the US behaves like an ordinary power.
Now I wonder whether I was right.
Indeed, China’s government has actually been encouraging rural laborers to move to cities to find better jobs.
To achieve “permanent urbanization,” China must develop a new safety net.
That may not be achievable overnight.
In the coming days, Japan will welcome Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of President John F. Kennedy and the likely new US ambassador.
First, would even a partial withdrawal of military force create a security vacuum that could be filled by a rival – say, China or Iran?
But ten years ago, so did the possibility of an American disengagement from the region.
First, confusion.
Although the effect is to raise revenue, that is just an accounting convention.
There are many options in designing such a policy.
Why is Obama Winning?
According to United States Census data, household income fell in 2011 for the fourth consecutive year.
And yet Obama seems likely to be reelected in November.
John Maynard Keynes and his disciples pushed the idea that even apparently useless projects, such as pyramid construction in ancient Egypt, made sense.
Keynes’s Cambridge disciple, Joan Robinson, was particularly worried because Hitler seemed to have grasped this point more quickly than democratic governments had.
The differences between African countries are too huge.
Even within countries, say Tanzania where the mainland and the island of Zanzibar are usually at loggerheads, there are often radical differences in opinion and approach.
In a very different setting, the European Union was created on the basis of shared values and shared objectives.
Its early history began while much of Europe was rebuilding itself after WWII.
The Organisation of African Unity, renamed the African Union, set itself impossibly high objectives when it was founded in 1963.
The parallel with Europe's integration is striking.
Such knowledge is essential if investors and donors in Africa are to support the practical, regionally-based policies Africa needs.
Africa's diversity is Africa's strength.
Using and Abusing the Hague Tribunal
Croatia provides a textbook case of this.
NEW YORK – Science may be humankind’s greatest success as a species.
But the scientific enterprise is under threat from both external and internal forces.
Now, with perverse incentives undermining their credibility and hampering research, scientists must take matters into their own hands.
NEW DELHI – Last December’s fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi triggered an unprecedented public outcry in India.
The commission’s roughly 700-page report, completed in only 29 days, urged the government to take swift, far-reaching action.
Moreover, discrimination in India often begins in the family.
Policies based on generalities will not work.
I was impressed and encouraged that roughly four-fifths of the 85 children were fully vaccinated.
In fact, we are already seeing the new framework take shape.
But, unlike most dreams, this one is achievable.
Vaccines have always had a special meaning for me.
Back then – in the early 1930’s – there was no vaccine for this highly infectious disease.
Just a quarter-century ago, polio was endemic in 125 countries – and paralyzed more than 1,000 children every day.
In the remaining three countries where polio has not yet been eliminated – Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria – there were just 223 reported cases in 2012.
Most of them live in poor and remote communities that still lack access to the basic vaccines that are universally available in better-off countries.
Fortunately, the world is taking action.
Now we need funds, commitment, and the resolve to implement the plan presented in Abu Dhabi.
The life of Vaclav Havel, who is stepping down as president of the Czech Republic, could serve as inspiration for one of Havel's own absurdist plays.
It is impossible to separate Havel the playwright from Havel the dissident or Havel the political leader.
His earliest plays were political, ridiculing the wooden locutions of communist rhetoric.
Havel continued writing, changing his genre from plays and essays to speeches, most of which are, in fact, philosophical writings.
But elevation to the heights of power in this way has its costs.
Veiled Sexuality
At home, in the context of marital intimacy, Victoria’s Secret, elegant fashion, and skin care lotions abounded.
I felt, yes, in certain ways, free.
Nor are Muslim women alone.
The Western Christian tradition portrays all sexuality, even married sexuality, as sinful.
Islam and Judaism never had that same kind of mind-body split.
Choice is everything.
Veils of Ignorance
Insisting on the religious side of the ban radically changed the very meaning of the law.
Venezuela’s Choice
So is he on the way out?
But the opposition's task is far from finished.
That won't be easy.
Victors’ Justice, Iraqi-Style
Moreover, their triumphalist rejoicing is a cruel reminder that when the oppressed become liberated, they can very easily turn into oppressors themselves.
The consequences of this re-ordering of power are not yet clear.
Vietnam’s Chinese Lessons
No longer.
In late October, Hanoi hosted the East Asian Summit, a meeting at which the US and Russia were recognized as Asian powers with vital national interests in the region.
Deng wanted to punish the Vietnamese for their own invasion of Cambodia, which ended the genocidal rule of China’s allies, the Khmer Rouge.
The first example of it was the brief Sino-Indian War of 1962.
Vietnam has also become a major exporter of clothes, shoes, and furniture.
These are soon to be joined by microchips, given the $1 billion factory that chipmaker Intel built outside Ho Chi Minh City.
Virtual Vices
In a popular Internet role-playing game called Second Life, people can create a virtual identity for themselves, choosing such things as their age, sex, and appearance.
Depending on your preferences, you can have sex with someone who is older or younger than you – perhaps much older or younger.
In fact, if your virtual character is an adult, you can have sex with a virtual character who is a child.
But is it seriously wrong to have virtual sex with a virtual child?
Some Second Life players say that it is, and have vowed to expose those who do it.
Meanwhile, the manufacturers, Linden Labs, have said they will modify the game to prevent virtual children from having sex.
Laws against child pornography in other countries may also have the effect of prohibiting games that permit virtual sex with virtual children.
It becomes much more dubious when it interferes with sexual acts between consenting adults.
But looking at the question in this way raises another, and perhaps more significant, issue about virtual activities: video game violence.
In a chilling videotape they made before the massacre, Harris says “It's going to be like fucking Doom….That fucking shotgun [he kisses his gun] is straight out of Doom!”
Vladimir de Gaulle?
Or will it adjust to them?
Russia also will not transform its economic system along Anglo-American lines.
A suggestive analogy may be to France during the long period of Anglo-American hegemony.
Charles de Gaulle took France out of the NATO military alliance in 1966.
LONDON &#45;&#45; Opinions about Vladimir Putin run the gamut.
The voters will enthusiastically elect anyone who has Putin’s blessing.
In these circumstances, an isolated and increasingly unpopular regime might decide to cancel or rig the presidential election when it fell due.
This is what happened in Ukraine in November 2004, with revolutionary consequences.
Despite Russia’s history after 1917, one dominant political party is preferable to none at all.
Is the lion scared of the mouse?
Or is the mouse actually not that small and harmless?
While Putin still has considerable resources at his disposal, using them will become increasingly costly – politically, economically, and socially.
So what is going on here?
Putin’s political genius is that he understands that, for Russians, being perceived as powerful is even more important than actually being powerful.
Nothing could be farther from the truth.
But synchronizing the two processes is necessary for other reasons, too.
Likewise, the fighting has created highly fluid conditions in the Kurdish-majority areas of Iraq and Syria.
What, however, would Kurdish independence mean for the rest of Iraq?
This would be a strong incentive to go to Geneva.
Voodoo Economics Revisited
(Indeed, her book with Ken Rogoff, This Time Is Different, should be required reading for US policymakers.)
Most American politicians like to think and talk only about the US.
A year from now, what kind of economy will the US have?
Next up is French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s anticipated re-election bid.
France has higher taxes and social-welfare benefits than the United Kingdom, Canada, or the US.
But Harper’s re-election suggests otherwise.
·        France has the highest government spending as a share of GDP – well over 50%, according to the OECD – and this has increased continually, decade after decade;
These differences are the equivalent of an entire generation of economic progress.
But comparing the US, Canada, the UK, and France reveals that the stakes are immense.
This is the season for Asian gatherings.
Summits are a circus with many rings and acronyms.
Afterwards, he will go to China and South Korea.
But more is needed and should be expected of him.
Keeping Japan close is a starting point.
One such initiative is for freer trade.
But, with Myanmar included, this may be too difficult politically, and an ASEAN sub-grouping may be more realistic.
Interestingly, the video shows how the stores spread out like petals of a flower, ever thickening and expanding.
Consumers pay significantly less than at traditional outlets.
Big-box stores are not exactly attractive – hence their name.
Indeed, many Europeans, and others, will view Holmes’s video simulation of Wal-Mart’s spread as a horror film.
China’s North Korean Pivot
This was quickly followed by a Beijing summit between Xi and South Korean President Park Geun-hye.
But China upgraded its role in the 2000’s.
Indeed, North Korean behavior became much more provocative, including an attack in 2010 that sank the South Korean corvette Cheonan and another in which the South’s Yeonpyeong Island was shelled.
As a result, China’s North Korea policy has entered a new stage.
Wanted: An Arab Jean Monnet
An instrument for it already exists: the new Union for the Mediterranean.
And it has protected China from the financial crisis, which shook the developed world to its core.
External considerations, too, cry out for allowing the renminbi to appreciate.
The imbalances in the US are the mirror image of China’s.
Now it must go a step further and engage in consensus-building internationally.
In Rome, the army’s sit-down strike in the fifth century B.C. opened politics to the lower classes.
Common warriors were, explicitly and famously, the decision makers among Norsemen and in Swiss Alpine cantons in the early Middle Ages.
America’s extended conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, however, are different.
Overall public debt, to which each year’s deficit adds another hefty dollop, is projected to exceed 100% of GDP in 2011, up from around 40% in the late 1970’s.
It is worth recalling Walter Benjamin's observation that "every document of civilization is simultaneously a document of barbarism."
The problem is that no law of nature guarantees this.
Meanwhile, the actual conduct of intrastate war is growing more, not less, barbarous.
In fact, the assault on IHL comes not simply from warlords from Ivory Coast to Chechnya to Aceh.
The so-called "war on terrorism" saw to this.
War and the Environment
Effects of chemicals used by armed forces. Restrictions on civilian use are often not applied to the military.
Exposure to chemical warfare agents following the detonation of Iraq munitions in Khamisiyah has been discussed as a cause of the syndrome. 
Removal of some 1.6 million landmines in Kuwait cost in more than $400 million.
War Without End on Congo’s Women
NEW YORK – The violence in Congo is unspeakable.
Violence has displaced more than 350,000 people in eastern Congo since the beginning of 2007.
The international community, too, has failed.
Some of these facilities may be modest local clinics with a few beds.
Patients admitted to ICUs become colonized rapidly with hospital bacterial pathogens, which often are resistant to antibiotics. 
The thirst for technology is not accompanied by an appetite for infection control. 
Yet, much can be done.
Wars Against Women
The biggest fear of rape victims in Darfur, however, is that they will never find a husband.
In the wars now savaging the Democratic Republic of Congo, rape victims also take most of the blame.
The subsequent stigma often is a heavier burden than the assault itself.
According to the German journalist Ruth Andreas-Friedrich, the shame felt about “lost honor” created an “atmosphere of suicide.”
The impunity that is characteristic of these heinous crimes must stop.
Prosecution must become the rule.
That must change as well.
There should be a monument to the Unknown Raped Woman at the ICC.
That Facebook group already has around 30,000 “likes.”
By contrast, far from causing the demise of an armed movement, the killing of a charismatic leader at the hands of his enemies can transform such a figure into a martyr.
Che Guevera was far more valuable to leftist militancy after his death than he was while alive.
Since 9/11, Al Qaeda has been far from a hierarchical, cult-like organization.
Al Qaeda’s franchise model applies to Algeria, Yemen, North Mali, and Somalia as well.
Qutb was executed by Gamel Abdel Nasser’s dictatorship in Egypt in August 1966, in an attempt to reduce his influence.
Moreover, Qutb was executed by an Arab Nationalist Muslim leader, whereas Bin Laden was killed by US Navy Seals.
Washington and the Art of the Possible
The absence of broad consensus is no wonder.
There are two key divisive factors: income and age.
But the rich are not the idle rich of the past; they are the working rich.
Water for All
This month, water once again takes center stage at the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City.
As a result, they are increasingly vulnerable to poor health.
A single drought can cut growth potential by 10% over an extended period.
CHAPEL HILL, NC – Despite recent progress, more than one billion people still lack decent water supplies, and more than two billion go without sanitation services.
Estimates of what people in poor nations are willing to pay for piped water do not exceed the costs for many water and sanitation projects.
The filter typically costs a household about $1.40 per month, but in many developing countries yields benefits from improved health that are three times higher.
The community is provided with financial incentives to construct and maintain very basic household latrines.
Water management is an inherently difficult challenge, and experience counts for a lot.
Moreover, interference is constant, and inevitable, between the public and the private sectors.
The multiplicity of interlocutors inevitably creates a multiplicity of water systems with vastly unequal levels of efficiency.
One casualty of such debates has been the myth that water is free.
Only the state can be made responsible here.
Australia, too, is grappling with serious droughts in the agricultural heartland of the Murray-Darling River basin.
Moreover, the Himalayan glaciers that feed Pakistan’s rivers may melt by 2050, owing to global warming.
Such a gathering would enable information-sharing, which could save lives and economies.
Should all the details of what was done be released and publicized?
Should there be a special commission to investigate?
But these are not the main grounds upon which the torture debate is being fought out in the US today.
But are these really the proper terms on which this debate should be held?
In the case of torture, that is the aim, which is why it is different from other acts of war.
Separation of ownership from management and effective securities markets reinforce each other.
But these institutions reflect the political power of social forces, not the differences between civil-law and common-law systems.
So they do.
Wealth and the Culture of Nations
Modern growth came not from better incentives, but from the creation of a new economic culture in societies like England and Scotland.
Yet there was no economic growth.
Profit opportunities from converting common land into private land, which had existed since the Middle Ages, were finally pursued.
A skilled Nigerian immigrant in the US, for example, has more opportunities there than if he returned to Nigeria.
People come first.
After the military coup in 1952, the Soviets provided much of the needed aid.
Their “technical” experts turned the country’s second city, Alexandria, into a Russian country club.
Egypt can only hope for cash infusions to offset its internal hemorrhaging.
Egypt is the largest wheat importer in the world, and food subsidies account for approximately 2% of GDP.
Beyond such questions lies the fate of democracy in one of civilization’s most ancient lands.
Weimar Russia Revisited
Weimar Germany blindly poisoned itself.
But the virus of nationalism has survived and multiplied.
Today’s hardcore Russian nationalists consider Putin’s regime too soft, too pragmatic, too reasonable – in their language, “weak and indecisive.”
The “Putin Center” can be displaced.
These are the key ingredients in the nationalist stew that seems to appeal to Russians nowadays.
Indeed, the most popular tactic among liberals nowadays is to unite with all opponents of the regime.
Definitely not."
But Daniels decided he would rather run for office in Indiana than take a stand in support of sound fiscal finance;
But that is my hope, not my forecast.
ZURICH – It is all too easy to envy China.
But copycat capitalism is not without risk; indeed, it is unlikely to end without someone getting scratched.
In January, the European Union expanded eastward once again.
In fact, this is partly the case.
According to empirical studies, the group of losers ranges from low-skilled to skilled workers with a completed educational training.
Western European wages are far too rigid for the benefits of competition and sectoral change to be shared by a majority of workers.
There is also talk of NATO accession by Australia, South Korea, Japan, and New Zealand.
Every hill will become strategic, and every gully will become historic.
Of course, Russia is not Serbia.
Westernize the Black Sea Region
The Black Sea is poised to become a key conduit for non-OPEC, non-Gulf oil and natural gas flowing into European markets and beyond.
For example, NATO already has three members - Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey - bordering the Black Sea.
As opposed to a 100- or 200-meter sprint, both organizations need to think more in terms of a much longer race, perhaps a marathon.
They inhibit democratization and incite instability.
It is also possible to see in the politics of both parties mounting concern about globalization.
The possibilities are endless.
Real estate booms have been going on in these countries’ major cities for years.
That is how it was with housing until the late 1970’s.
Indeed, while changes in fundamental perceptions may not occur easily or fast, they should never be ruled out.
What Bolivia\u0027s Chaos Means
As a landlocked Andean country, Bolivia suffers its own special distress.
Sánchez de Lozada pressed again for US financial help--$150 million--but Bush ushered him from the Oval Office with a pat on the back.
Even as Sánchez de Lozada was hounded from office on the streets of La Paz as an American lackey, the Bush administration showed no interest or support.
So now European leaders say that it is the current-account deficits of the eurozone’s member countries that must be kept in check.
To me, this makes sense, but such policies should be anathema to the EU’s free-market advocates.
These problems will occur with or without the euro.
(Some point out that this means that America’s corporations can buy senators from such states at a lower price.)
What China Wants in 2012
China is the world’s largest developing country; Europe is the largest bloc of developed countries; and the US is the largest single developed country.
Together, we account for nearly a third of humanity and two-thirds of the world economy.
Likewise, the world cannot develop without China.
Over the Cliff We Go
American tax rates will revert overnight to their Clinton-era levels.
Second, and more important for those who worry about the US economy’s health, the process is not well-described by the term “fiscal cliff.”
That way, they will affect the economy gradually over five years, rather than all at once.
The end of the bipolar world represented a great opportunity to make the international order more humane.
We, the Europeans, have one specific task.
Industrial civilization, which now spans the whole world, originated in Europe.
What Corporate Tax for Europe?
What do Egypt’s Generals Want?
Thus declared General Mukhtar al-Mulla, a member of Egypt’s ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF).
But they are not alone.
Despite everything, democratic Egypt is not a romantic fantasy.
What Do Muslim Women Want?
Some right-wing American bloggers recently twisted an article that I wrote in a way that did just that.
She directed my attention to Jordanian-made films about the subordination of women inside the home, and to Rana Husseini’s powerful book on honor killings, Murder in the Name of Honor .
Nazzal was trained as a British barrister, and chairs the board of the Human Rights Legal Aid Fund.
What Does America Want?
I speak not of principles, but of policy.
America's armed forces are an essential background to much of what the US accomplishes internationally.
If all you have to work with is a hammer, as the saying goes, every problem looks like a nail.
Not even the UN has a monopoly on legitimacy, which depends most on an action's rationale and the manner in which it is undertaken.
What Does Japan Want from America?
FRANKFURT – What constitutes a crisis?
So, why is there a eurozone crisis, and what defines it?
Other countries, like Norway and Switzerland, are running current-account surpluses that exceed 10% of their GDP, but are resisting currency revaluation.
Much remains unknown.
France’s German Mirror
BERLIN – Berlin’s Tegel Airport, which still greets most of the passengers arriving in the capital of Europe’s leading economic power, is outdated and provincial.
Of course, if you can afford to live there, Paris remains a great place to be.
But Berlin is a better place to work, even if what you do is very poorly paid.
And, even on a low salary, he can live and raise his children in the city itself.
Today, like Pope Francis, she is clearly at ease with herself.
Yet today’s debate in France over the German model reminds one eerily of the discussions that followed France’s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War.
The places of power in France do not encourage modesty.
More than 8,000 Palestinians are held in Israeli prisons, many without charge or trial.
The Resource Raj rose from the ashes of the License Raj.
As a result, industrial, mining, and infrastructure projects have ground to a halt.
Because India does not produce much gold itself, these purchases have contributed to an abnormally wide current-account deficit.
NEW YORK – Mohammed al-Hanashi was a 31-year-old Yemeni citizen who was held at Guantánamo Bay without charge for seven years.
Because my commercial flight was canceled, I got a ride back to the United States on a military transport.
When would there be an investigation of the death, I asked him? “That was the investigation,” he replied.
The military had investigated the military.
Their interiors resemble the inside of a smooth plastic jar; there are no hard edges; hooks fold down; there is no bedding that one can use to strangle oneself.
Can you kill yourself in the psych ward?
The Yemeni government, too, notes that they have yet to receive the coroner’s report from the US.
Actually, I sent it twice.
Being a pioneer is hardly a guarantee of riches.
The shift away from fossil fuels will not be easy.
In this piece of inspired oversimplification, cultural 'diversity' is invariably seen as a boon rather than a threat.
What takes place in the interface of human rights and humanitarianism is often the conflict of two rights.
Investors withdrew in droves from what was once deemed the “Celtic Tiger.”
“Not so fast,” says the other side.
Investors in the coming years will need to be persuaded to hold mountains of new debt.
Unfortunately, in 2009, the global economy will not be a bed of roses.
What is the Dollar’s Sustainable Value?
How much further will the dollar fall?
Or has it already fallen so far that it will now start to move back to a higher level?
Just two years ago, it was being downsized, and serious people were asking whether it should be closed down.
The Fund is a beehive of activity.
By seeming to give ground on this point in the effort to win friends and influence people, the IMF has created unnecessary confusion.
But why the FSB should head up this process is far from clear.
Small countries are subject to market discipline, as any Latvian will tell you.
But, as the sub-prime mortgage debacle reminds us, large countries’ policies can place the global financial system at risk.
There can be no more mincing of words.
The Fund has been notable mainly for its silence.
What is the West?
PARIS &#45;&#45; Everyone everywhere has by now heard about the “clash of civilizations.”
This Samuel Huntington concept has become universal.
One reason these phrases gain wide acceptance is their lack of clear definition.
Is Russia part of the West?
From these uncertainties, we can conclude that the West is not a geographic entity.
The term could be applied to all walks of life in the West.
A true Muslim or Chinese scholar cannot be defined as a true Chinese or a true Muslim by being critical of his own world.
This is not the case in most non-Western civilizations.
Where do we draw the line between West and East?
Will the West remain Western?    
Similarly, a modern Egyptian or a modern Saudi will be more on par with a French or an American than they would be with an ancient Arab.
Until the late 1800’s, most of Africa was unexplored and occupied by hunter-gatherers and practitioners of subsistence agriculture.
The only territorial units resembling those that exist today were Ethiopia, Liberia, and South Africa.
Only Botswana and Namibia achieved respectable scores, while the worst offenders were Cameroon, Uganda, Kenya, Angola, Madagascar, and Nigeria.
The normal balancing of costs against benefits is not allowable here.
On the contrary, our aim is if possible to avoid such collateral deaths.
What Lies Ahead in 2011?
This two-track world poses some unusual risks.
This is not the only, or even the most important, downside risk facing the global economy.
PRINCETON – Barack Obama worked for three years as a community organizer on Chicago’s blighted South Side, so he knows all about the real poverty that exists in America.
Yet Obama’s campaigning has focused on “Main Street” and tax cuts for the middle class, bypassing the issue of what to do about poverty. 
Obama wants the goal to be an 80% reduction and McCain says 66%, but, since the next president will leave office no later than 2016, that difference is irrelevant.
What Money Can Buy
All citizens should have equal access.
So we have to “sell” entry.
Something seems wrong when a lung or a kidney is sold for money.
What kind of society do we live in if people have to sell their organs to survive?
The seller is giving up part of her body in an irreversible transaction.
If that money had been earned by selling a portion of a lung, or represented savings painfully accumulated during years of backbreaking work, we might consider the exchange more equal.
TOKYO – Today, there are very few things that money can’t buy.
Is there anything wrong with buying and selling these things?
The difference is this: A market economy is a tool – a valuable and effective tool – for organizing productive activity.
Prostitution is a classic example.
It also applies to civic goods and practices.
Both parties to the transaction would be better off.
But that is a mistake.
In the end, whatever light there is, it may not shine until 2007, after the French elections.
What Next in Afghanistan?
What, many people are asking, is NATO really fighting for in Afghanistan?
In the US, the debate about the purposes being served in Afghanistan is at least still taking place.
In 1989, when the Cold War ended, the Red Army had already withdrawn from the country, thereby admitting its defeat.
Afghanistan may seem far away, but its chaos and violence are in fact just next door.
They are right.
This would be a lot easier with the Constitution in place, but there are measures that can and should be adopted now to make that possible.
After falling in 2009, China’s surplus with the US and Europe increased by 32% and 16%, respectively, in 2010.
Ordinary exports are produced using Chinese factors of production, and ordinary imports are intended for China’s internal market.
But the risks of inertia seemed to be even higher.
The pattern of weakness accelerated in April and May.
SAO PAULO – Brazil, Russia, India, and China recently held their second annual summit in Brasilia.
What’s Left After 1989?
Only individuals and families counted.
It was everyone for themselves.
It merely shifted from left to right.
It seems unlikely.
He has some modest ideals, and may yet be an excellent president.
So what should replace it?
Most Westerners think the answer is liberal democracy, as did many Chinese liberals in the twentieth century.
Ever since the Han dynasty (more than 2,000 years ago), Chinese governments have manipulated the most prominent political interpretations of Confucianism for their own purposes.
The first reforms to Afghanistan's army will only make these divisions worse.
But this is not the case.
An eleventh served as a pilot.
What do all these statistics mean in terms of day-to-day reality?
Is this a team likely to bring war-torn Afghanistan together?
A typical reaction was to raise the forecast for 2011 from 2.5% to 3.5%.
So, either the initial 2.5% forecast was too high or the increase of one percentage point is too large.
No new benefit has been created.
What’s Stopping Women?
Reactions differ across countries, of course.
The Germans are deeply conflicted.
So what went wrong?
In April, on his first foreign trip following his inauguration, Lee traveled to the US.
Police work became more efficient.
This makes sense.
Is Europe's right doomed to extinction or extremism?
Perhaps the collapsing popularity of the right in our new democracies tells something about the right in Europe's old democracies.
No longer was it neo-liberal.
Their warmth seemed nothing but political hot air.
It is a carbon copy of the language of the social-democrats who are so successful in Western Europe.
Foreign policy played almost no role in the 2000 US presidential election.
Then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice praised the virtues of “transformational diplomacy.”
Mohandas Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, and Martin Luther King, Jr., played crucial roles in transforming people’s identity and aspirations.
Franklin Roosevelt and Truman made crucial contributions.
In foreign policy, as in medicine, it is important to remember the Hippocratic Oath: first, do no harm.
Decline is a misleading metaphor.
We do not live in a “post-American world,” but we also do not live in the American era of the late twentieth century.
This report mentioned that in 2003 some 21,870 Turks submitted asylum claims in the EU, of which 2,127 were accepted.
Not much has changed since accession talks began this October.
In May, the largest teachers’ union was banned for promoting the education of Turkey’s 14 million Kurds in their own language.
Moreover, Turkey’s accession would lead inevitably to that of Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova, and perhaps of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaïdjan.
Leaving the three Caucasian republics aside but including the successor states to Yugoslavia, this would mean an EU of some 35 members.
What sort of Union would that be?
But they were necessary.
What Should Bretton Woods II Look Like?
Two fundamental problems exist with the call for reform.
In all these areas, the IMF should make more active use of regional institutions.
Officials want to be reassuring.
The problems of Portugal and Spain might be less severe than those of Greece and Ireland, but this apparently is not enough to induce investors to buy their government debt.
But if the exit looks comfortably large, the public will be much more likely to remain calm, even if parts of the room are already filling with smoke.
For example, the Spanish banking sector alone has short-term liabilities of several hundred billion euros.
Something similar might have to be done for the Spanish banking system’s exposure to the local housing market.
Tinker, Tailor, Snowden, Spy?
What the West Can Do
Yet Georgia’s president remains in power.
All this has been halted by Russian tanks.
In the long run, Georgia and Russia must coexist peacefully.
What Threatens Russia?
Poland immediately associated the idea with the pre-war Danzig (Gdansk) Corridor and interpreted it as an ex-territorial encroachment on Polish sovereignty.
But this is not so.
A vacuum never survives for long.
The difference is literally one of degrees - educational degrees.
What to Expect From the 44th President
But what about the future?
Pakistan’s western reaches are now a sanctuary for militias and terrorists that are moving in and out of Afghanistan.
Obama seems to regard meeting with foreign leaders as a normal component of foreign policy, to be employed as one of many tools.
It was the ultimate proof that the Bush administration does not believe in universal norms.
As America’s legitimacy diminishes, new actors are appearing on the world stage – or returning for an encore.
America retains unique qualities – particularly its ability to rebound.
But they should also be supplemented by other devices.
In my 2003 book, New Financial Order: Risk in the 21st Century, I proposed a different idea, which I called “livelihood insurance.”
It would also rely on the market rather than a government program.
The vast majority of avian flu outbreaks in the past four years, in both humans and poultry, have occurred in Indonesia.
It is dangerous folly, however, to extend this policy to viruses.
They must get involved.
When are Public Services Successful?
How do we judge the quality of public services?
Surely not.
They should be safe, too, and reasonably comfortable.
But is this what we really want?
Moreover, many public services are so-called "soft services."
Education is in all cases about more than achieving a certain "throughput."
For every road to new discoveries, there will be several negative results and cul-de-sacs.
At the other end--that of results--some targets do make sense.
Trains should run on time.
Such bodies may seem weak at first sight.
When Doctors Kill
Helicopters were called in to evacuate patients.
She injected them with morphine and another drug that slowed their breathing until they died.
When others from his ward were evacuated, he asked not to be left behind.
The Pope said that it was.
Dr. Cook had little time for such subtleties.
At Memorial Medical Center, physicians and nurses found themselves under great pressure.
She somehow has a spacious house, but no proper beds for the kids.
Sound familiar?
The EDC would have created a European army, in which even German troops would have been included.
But now, as back then, fear and doubt won the day.
Back in the 1950’s, the founding nations’ foreign ministers promptly turned to their Belgian colleague, Paul-Henri Spaak, for fresh proposals.
When India Votes
This time, the electorate includes 714 million voters, an increase of 43 million over the previous general election in 2004.
Independent candidates can choose from an assortment of alternatives, ranging from a cricket bat to images of various large animals.
Even when fashionable stocks dipped, there was remarkably little effect on the rest of the market.
Indeed, the internet boom/bust cycle brings into question prevailing economic theories about financial markets.
Instead, they are contingent on the behavior of financial markets.
In the summer of 1999 I was convinced that an internet crash was imminent.
This perversity is not without reason.
They are not alone in this respect.
Turkey’s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is in the same camp.
Only the frail and ailing 85-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej still functions as a symbol of national cohesion.
This does not bode well for Thai democracy.
Another military intervention is the last thing the country needs.
And yet many Egyptians, including some human-rights activists, have endorsed it.
And foreign governments, including that of the United States, are averting their eyes.
No democracy in the Middle East that fails to take account of Islam will work.
When Marijuana is Legal
BRISBANE – What will happen if Californians votes this November to legalize marijuana use by any adult over the age of 21 years?
Padang is one of those communities.
Just to its northwest, in Banda Aceh, 160,000 lives were lost in the 2004 tsunami.
The idea is to build small hills in low-lying parts of the city, with level tops that could be used as parks or sports fields.
After 20 years of operation, the organization remains tiny, especially when compared to organizations like the Red Cross, which primarily do disaster relief work.
People give to identifiable victims.
But isn’t it much better to keep parents safe than to help orphans after their parents have been killed?
They are still capitulating to this day.
Because farming takes place outdoors and in dirt, such contamination is a fact of life.
The bacterial genes express proteins that are toxic to corn-boring insects, but that are harmless to birds, fish, and mammals, including humans.
Cancer affects many different organs and tissues in the body.
Genes are chemical coding units that specify the structure and function of our bodies.
What makes one kind of cell different from another is the combination of genes that are active in each cell. 
Occasionally, however, damage is not repaired.
Tumor suppressor genes can be disabled by mutation, or by spontaneous loss during cell division.
The molecular signatures can be used to classify cancers more precisely, making them easier to treat.
Similar techniques have been used to identify genes involved in tumor metastasis. 
Close observation and rapid treatment, or prophylactic surgery, can reduce the risk of these inherited forms of cancer. 
New imaging techniques are also helping to guide surgery, so that tumors can be removed more precisely. 
New drugs, which have been designed to inhibit tumor angiogenesis, are showing promise in clinical trials. 
For example, nerve cells are produced in excess, and some die in order for proper connections to be established in the nervous system.
Some of the genes involved in the suicide program are the same genes that are altered in cancer cells.
When Women Lead
MUNICH – Would the world be more peaceful if women were in charge?
In The Better Angels of Our Nature, Pinker presents data showing that human violence, while still very much with us today, has been gradually declining.
So we are left with the broader question: does gender really matter in leadership?
In some circumstances, men will need to act more “like women”; in others, women will need to be more “like men.”
Both men and women will make those decisions.
But there is reason to doubt the conventional wisdom.
Europe also would continue to be dominated by the interests of the big countries, with the small countries in the back of the bus.
The fate of the Franco-German axis, in particular, hinges on the outcome of the referendum.
If Chirac goes down, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder loses face as well. Two birds would be wounded with one stone.
With the funding assured, the G-8 would suddenly move from empty promises to real policies.
Governments are engaged in a massive negotiation, but they are not engaged in a massive effort at problem-solving.
Similarly, we will need renewed public confidence in a new generation of nuclear power, with plants that are safe and reliably monitored.
We will need to switch from cars with internal-combustion engines to hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery-powered, and fuel-cell-powered vehicles.
Consider the United States.
Thus, China’s emissions path depends crucially on early testing of the CCS technologies.
Conspiracy theories abound, particularly among the ranks of financial traders, for whom volatility is like wind to a sailor.
Traders did not win every battle, of course.
So will today’s relative market calm continue?
Where’s Europe?
Drawn up by the Belgian member of the Commission who held the industry portfolio, several of its provisions are clearly relevant to the current situation, not least to the automobile industry.
It doesn’t really matter whether a new crisis-beating EU strategy bears some resemblance to the largely forgotten Davignon Plan.
So what comes next? 
The genome's language is DNA, whose alphabet has just four different letters: G, C, A, and T. But the genome contains three billion of these letters.
In a book, words are collected into sentences, sentences into paragraphs, and paragraphs into chapters.
Each level provides a higher, more coherent level of meaning.
So, too, with the human genome.
The first draft of the human genome, published in February 2001, provided four new fundamental insights.
First, humanity's Book of Life has only 30,000-35,000 different words, or genes.
Second, there are essentially no race-specific words in the Book of Life.
Indeed, the Book of Life for two Black people may differ more than that for a Caucasian person and a Black person.
Many fundamental biological systems composed of these genes and proteins are remarkably similar.
The knowledge contained in the Book of Life has catalyzed paradigm changes in biology and medicine.
Which Globalization Will Survive?
The oldest form of globalization is environmental.
For example, the first smallpox epidemic was recorded in Egypt in 1350 BC.
It reached China in 49 AD, Europe after 700, the Americas in 1520, and Australia in l789.
Global climate change will affect the lives of people everywhere.
The rate at which the sea level rose in the last century was ten times faster than the average rate over the last three millennia.
During the Cold War, the global strategic interdependence between the United States and the Soviet Union was acute and well recognized.
Finally, social globalization consists in the spread of peoples, cultures, images, and ideas.
Migration is a concrete example.
Ideas are an equally important aspect of social globalization.
But protectionism will not curb the other forms of globalization.
Which Way is West for Turkey?
The two countries still recognize many mutual interests, but now they manage these interests on a far different basis.
Previously, Turkey viewed Iraq solely in the context of its domestic Kurdish problem.
The northern border with Turkey is their lifeline to the outside world.
If this approach succeeds, Europe's bridge to Asia may also become its bridge to America.
Yeltsin never spread his fingers into the nooks and crannies of government as comprehensively as Putin.
Nothing escapes the eye of the Kremlin--whether it be which buildings are restored in Saint Petersburg or the appointment of minor Russian envoys abroad.
No one knows.
White House Sex Crimes
Silence, and even collusion, is also typical of sex crimes within a family.
Whither Africa’s “Frontier Markets”?
There are three main reasons why many sub-Saharan countries are performing well.
Most of Nigeria’s problems are well known.
None of these options is easy; each entails serious difficulties and great risks.
Whither Pakistan?
So, is a further increase in violence by various extremist groups likely?
Will the economy collapse if the IMF withdraws its support?
Whither the Dollar?
Whither the Egyptian Revolution?
Will the regional security structure formed around the United States, Egypt, and Israel survive?
It appears unlikely that a single party will emerge from the election with enough parliamentary seats to govern on its own.
Approximately one-third of the new parliament will comprise “non-party list” candidates.
American monetary policy decisions depend on the strength or weakness of the domestic economy and on US inflation.
The dollar is kept “strong” in terms of its purchasing power over US goods and services.
It has no such thing.
So what should America’s exchange rate policy be?
Who “Lost” Turkey?
Or, as Mikhail Gorbachev, that great Russian statesman of the last decades of the twentieth century, put it: “Life has a way of punishing those who come too late.”
Who Are Tomorrow’s Consumers?
What is going on?
Similarly, India has 104 million poor households and 107 million aspirant households.
However, the average Chinese will be 42.5 years old by 2030, compared to 39.1 for the average American.
The median Russian will be even older, at 43.3 years.
Meanwhile, the nature of the basic consuming unit – the household – is also changing rapidly.
In Germany, for example, 39% of households consist of just one person.
Couples with children now account for barely 19% and 22% of households in the United Kingdom and the US, respectively.
For example, we need to revise our mental image of the nuclear family from American suburbia to fit the rapidly expanding cities of India.
Who Beats Corruption?
How, then, to ensure that governments are law-abiding as well as strong?
The end result can be collapse into a kind of anarchy, as in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Somalia.
For example, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, and Rwanda rank much higher than Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Vietnam.
It is no surprise that corrupt regimes routinely clamp down on the press, trade unions, and on professional associations.
Who is to blame for this situation getting so out of control, and what is likely to happen next?
But the reality is that the IMF has no power over China (or any other country with a current-account surplus); the final communiqué last weekend was arguably the lamest on record.
But what will these banks do with the funds?
Who is Gordon Brown?
That is his first problem.
The one thing that is clear is that he will not gain legitimacy if he offers only more of what Blair has been dishing up for the past ten years.
This will be a difficult trick to pull off.
That situation is much worse among ethnic minorities.
At the top, the incomes of the mega-rich have soared, with predictable repercussions, especially in the property market.
Was it true?
Blair himself seems to prefer to have “friends” who are very rich and who will lend him their holiday villas in Tuscany.
Can Brown show that he is different?
This is partly a question of what to do now in Iraq; but it is also a question of Britain’s relationship with the US.
So far, there is no indication that he will.
But what about the political process?
Governments are now vulnerable, and politicians are under attack almost everywhere.
Administrations have collapsed in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Iceland, and Ireland.
The stock exchange boom of the early 1870’s was followed by collapse in 1873 and a witch-hunt for those responsible.
In 1907, J.P. Morgan was first viewed as the savior of the market, and then as the enemy of the commonweal.
In the 1930’s, bankers and finance ministers were accused.
As a result, they thought they lived in a world populated by demons and mysterious forces.
Finding out who is to blame becomes more and more like the late medieval and early modern search for witches: a way of making sense of a disorderly and hostile universe.
The Boston Paradox
MOSCOW – Whose fault is it that the Boston Marathon was bombed?
Their ties with the region are those of the diaspora.
The difference is that white men are not collectively blamed for the atrocities.
In Russia, too, the fallout is pernicious.
In this sense, the Boston bombings have been a diplomatic gift to him.
In that case, however, the Boston bombings appear to present a paradox.
Then it all came crashing down.
But what, then, were the credit rating agencies doing?
That it was a case of suicide?
Murder?
Or was it a rare instance of generalized organ failure?
You can bet your life savings on it.
This question remains hotly debated in media and policy circles across the West.
There is something contradictory about using the phrase “Who lost Russia?” to mean that the US tried too hard to help.
Russia probably hasn’t even done as badly as Ukraine, Belarus, and Central Asia.
The big decisions included:
Although the odds for success in 1991-2 were not great, the West had to try.
Not to try would have sent a signal that the West would never help.
The Turkish question is, of course, complex.
But for how long?
One does not play lightly with matches next to a pile of dry wood.
Who Needs the Humanities?
WARWICK, UK – Nowadays, in country after country, policymakers have become obsessed with the need to strengthen science education.
We need the humanities only if we are committed to the idea of humanity.
If the humanities have become obsolete, then it may be that humanity is losing its salience.
I do not mean that we are becoming “less human” in the sense of “inhumane.”
What was originally called the “liberal arts” provided the skills necessary for this transformation.
What is most easily measured has become confused with what is most worth measuring.
Who Needs the Social Sciences?
But what difference would their presence make?
Everyone else is relieved.
For Huxley, civilized society rose above nature by its systematic resistance to natural selection.
In his words, the human condition is not about "survival of the fittest" but "the fitting of as many as can survive."
All the other names in the ring have to be accompanied by a description – the former Finnish this or Austrian that.
It is about the job itself.
This was among the problems that the EU’s controversial Lisbon treaty was designed to fix.
The EU’s external relations involve two different types of politics.
Who Next at the ECB Helm?
During the financial crisis, the ECB has had an outstanding president in the person of Jean-Claude Trichet.
First and foremost, the next ECB president should excel on monetary matters.
Draghi’s Italian passport and his past service at Goldman Sachs do not help him much.
Both are suitable for the post.
The final decision, of course, rests with European heads of state and government.
A few months ago, Evo Morales became Bolivia‘s first democratically elected indigenous head of state.
Aymara and Quechua, their languages, were not even recognized for conducting public business.
So Morales’ election was historic, and the excitement in Bolivia is palpable.
It costs no more to extract oil or gas today than it did when prices were one-third of their current level.
Should Bolivia be paid a fair value for its resources?
But did they fully live up to their commitments?
It is a historic moment.
It isn’t called “factory farming” merely because those sheds look like factories.
Everything about the production method is geared towards turning live animals into machines for converting grain into meat or eggs at the lowest possible cost.
Walk into such a shed – if the producer will let you – and you will find up to 30,000 chickens.
When the chickens approach market weight, they cover the floor completely.
Now we see that these were only a small part of the total costs.
You can practically see the blood of US officials boil when they discuss it.
Yet Al Hurra is forbidden from broadcasting within the US, because it is state controlled.
America, however, is not alone in challenging Al Jazeera head on.
Al Jazeera is certainly professional.
In fact, Al Jazeera was founded only after the BBC closed its Arabic language station under Saudi pressure.
In July, Al Jazeera became the first Arab TV station to create a professional code of ethics.
If that becomes the West's standard, Al Jazeera will rightly be seen as part of the solution, not part of the problem.
COPENHAGEN – Imagine that over the next 70 or 80 years, a giant port city – say, Tokyo – found itself engulfed by sea levels rising as much as 15 feet or more.
Consider, for example, the findings of climate scientists Robert J. Nicholls, Richard S.J. Tol, and Athanasios T. Vafeidis.
But would it really be all that calamitous?
And that is over the course of a century.
But we quickly become desensitized, requiring ever more outrageous scenarios to move us.
When Strasbourg speaks, the world’s judges and lawyers listen.
But that approach seems unwise.
But they send a dangerous message that some governments should be exempt from standards that apply to everyone else.
But even democratic governments sometimes make big mistakes.
The questions are many.
No, the world is not about to run out of commodities.
Who\u0027s to Blame for Britain\u0027s Euro Allergy?
That is the current situation.
But if the British economy were doing very badly, the other member states might snub Britain.
Who’s Who on Putin’s Payroll?
It’s just that not all customers have the same motives.
The glib answer is because it is hard.
The UN conference won’t be easy.
Who Should Lead the World Bank?
That is good, but the US Treasury secretary will be the council’s chairman, and the Fed, despite gaining some new powers, will for the most part be only one of many members.
The Treasury secretary is part of the president’s team, and works next door to the White House.
Under the new law, Snow would have been in charge of the stability of the entire US economy.
Who Threatens Our Identity?
PRAGUE: Identity and sovereignty are often discussed nowadays.
But what do they actually mean?
How is this fate determined?
But the concept of community is also composed of concrete things.
Who Wants Cold War II?
What is the cause of this seeming paradox?
The Palestinian government is united administratively, but divided politically.
The Palestinians have one government with two policies.
We have nothing against Hamas; we are against their belligerent policies, which service in government has not changed.
There was a time when the PLO held positions that were the same as those of Hamas.
We will have nothing against negotiations.
We are for negotiations.
If such a right were recognized, there would be a Palestinian majority instead of a Jewish majority, which would mean the end of the Jewish state.
Indeed, the “right of return” contradicts the very idea of a two-state solution, as it would mean one state – a Palestinian state.
Of course, that issue is completely outside Israel’s control.
But it is also not very useful.
For example, did the British decline because the US could not be stopped, or because of problems within the British Empire and at home?
Isn’t this a version of exactly what derailed Japanese growth?
As I ponder this issue, I am reminded of a debate that I had more than ten years ago in Berlin with the German theologian Hans Küng and American and Asian participants.
Perhaps countries should seek to base their social-welfare systems on a new synthesis of the state, the family, and philanthropy.
But it has been part of the core bargain which has kept the union together.
But these are not likely to be the decisive considerations.
But if not, what will be the architecture of this enlarged EU?
And by whom?
But that is not the whole story. 
In short, the process is a mess.
Who Will Speak For The Larger Europe?
And how, belatedly, can that now be done?
If not a referendum, then what is to be done?
Beside reforms of Council and Commission, there is a leap of principle to be made here.
One example would be areas of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
It is one of the ironies of the last decade that at the end of it west European troops and civil servants are actually more present in Bosnia and Kosovo than they are in Bohemia or Silesia.
The stepping stones from military protectorate to political integration have to be thought out - and then spelled out.
And what have we to offer Ukraine, and other countries to the east?
Whose Champions, Anyway?
But the general trend is unambiguous.
The decision by Depfa Bank to shift its headquarters from Wiesbaden to Dublin in 2002 may be a sign of things to come.
With the rise of the business corporation, large family firms have generally disappeared.
Chairman Mao wanted a hundred flowers to bloom, but only so that he could cut them all off at their roots.
Instead, the model should be former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan’s initiative, the Global Compact.
Regardless of what the Saakashvili government claims about his opponents, our political orientation is not pro-Russian, but pro-Georgian.
Thus, pro-Georgian politics should not countenance nationalism.
Georgia should be neither pro-Russian nor pro-American.
It is a small, poor country that desperately needs stability and economic development.
America, they believe, only wants a democracy that suits its interests.
Ocampo, like Kim, brings the advantages and disadvantages of being an outsider; but Ocampo, a distinguished professor at Columbia University, is thoroughly acquainted with the World Bank.
Much is at stake.
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, required a strong response.
Invading Iraq was not.
It has given way to widespread resentment.
But war and occupation create innocent victims.
I want to shout: "Wake up America.
It is a war of choice, not necessity.
First the Iraqi army was dissolved, then America tried to reconstitute it.
Not anymore.
But it won't be easy for him, either, because America is caught in a quagmire.
Military success in Afghanistan addressed the easiest part of the problem.
Similarly, it was much easier to win the war in Iraq than to win the peace.
The paradox of American power is that the largest power since Rome cannot achieve many of its objectives unilaterally in a global information age.
Calling Off America’s Bombs
More than 100,000 people have died, and many of the world’s cultural and archaeological treasures have been demolished.
When the Arab Spring erupted in Tunisia and Egypt in January 2011, protests erupted in Syria as well.
The second phase began when the US helped to organize a large group of countries to back the rebellion.
In this, Russia was right.
Perhaps there is no underlying foreign-policy logic, but only carelessness.
The overriding idea is that the US and its close allies get to choose who governs in the region.
The Chinese economy has been doubling in size every ten years since 1978.
The Indian economy has been doing the same since 1991.
The seemingly obvious conclusion would be true but for the fact that Asia has a unique kind of hierarchical security system that came about partly by accident and partly by design.
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
But it is puzzling only if we characterize Asia as being multi-polar rather than hierarchical.
This keeps the top dog in check.
False triumphalism breeds poor discipline.
So it is no surprise that the American public and the US Congress are angry.
But it is not sufficient.
Hedge funds can also destabilize the system, as the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998 demonstrated.
Far from it.
Returning to that model is neither likely nor wise.
Waiting around for the advanced countries to right their ships so that we can all go back to the old normal is neither good policy nor a good bet.
A recession twice as deep as the one we have had would have cost the US roughly $2 trillion – and cost the world as a whole four times as much.
And any attempt to make investment bankers suffer more last fall and winter would have put the entire support operation at risk.
The Long Mystery of Low Interest Rates
A lot has changed since 2005.
So they save massively.
But predicting the timing of this transition is difficult.
People seem to want to work more than three hours a day, even if it is assembly-line work.
On the traditional family farm, there was no unemployment.
Some countries, notably Germany, have encouraged this approach.
But work-sharing raises technical problems if increased suddenly to deal with an economic crisis like the one we are now experiencing.
Their damaged morale certainly affects others as a sort of externality, which matters very much; but it does not matter to the firm that has laid them off.
Portugal’s economy is set to shrink by more than 2%, and Greece’s output will fall by more than 4%.
And Barack Obama has it.
Who do you want to see on your television screen for the next four years?
First, he promised bipartisanship, but got heavily rebuffed.
It is the most important attribute in politics.
The findings are clear.
The study cannot measure this increase.
PARIS – Who would have thought it?
What cuisine is to the French, soccer is to Brazilians: a matter of the highest national pride.
Rio de Janeiro is where soccer belongs.
Football was once a popular sport, rooted in local communities.
Local working-class boys played for local clubs that inspired fierce loyalty among fans.
They were part of people’s “identity.”
Football teams are now like multinational franchises, with coaches and players from all over the world.
It was striking to see how often the most prosperous-looking representatives came from the world’s poorest countries.
But once they have staged their spectacles, at vast expense to the host country, they move on.
They haven’t fallen out of love with football.
BRICS Without Mortar
Indeed, while the BRICS may be helpful in coordinating certain diplomatic tactics, the term lumps together highly disparate countries.
Most of what China and other developing countries produce and export are labor-intensive goods such as textiles and apparel.
After all, much of this labor force was absorbed by labor-intensive industries that eventually churned out products exported to the rest of the world.
Why Castro Survives
But other dissidents remain free.
That is the contradiction.
Amazingly, many Latin America leaders fail to make the connection between reducing poverty and their own popularity.
Their touchstones are Madrid, Paris, and New York.
It wasn't like another world or another planet; it was like another galaxy."
I want to see as they had the chance to see."
Why China Can’t Adjust
Indeed, nearly all mainstream economists prescribe this approach for China.
By contrast, if China’s private firms sell to Western multinationals, such as Wal-Mart, Target, or Home Depot, they do not have to worry about getting paid.
In its June 2011 survey, China was ranked 91st, behind Mongolia, Albania, and Belarus.
China cannot create such an environment quickly.
Why China\u0027s Falun Gong Movement Is Important
But there is a paradox here, for this “something new” is also something very old.
There are four reasons for this:
The state capitalism of the Greek Bronze Age or the Inca Empire was not motivated by economic inefficiency; nor did it necessarily create a more efficient economy.
The state plays a central role in modern society, and rightly so.
Controlling China’s Currency
BEIJING – It is indisputable that China is over-issuing currency.
To compare, M2 in the United States amounts to only roughly 63% of GDP.
In 2011, China accounted for an estimated 52% of the world’s added liquidity.
But a horizontal comparison of absolute values is inadequate to assess the true scale of China’s monetary emissions.
This generates liquidity, which then stimulates GDP growth.
China is already the world’s second largest economy, and will be the largest in 2017.
The question is reasonable enough if we don’t give it an American twist.
The analyst Chi Lo lucidly presents a picture of macro success alongside micro failure.
Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates all shelter under the US military umbrella.
Two important cultural values underpin China’s political system.
As the Analects of Confucius puts it: “Let the ruler be a ruler, the subject a subject, a father a father, and a son a son.”
There is also very little belief in the sanctity of human life: Buddhism holds that there is no difference between humans and animals and plants.
Similarly, private property ranks below collective&nbsp;property.
Today, the mandate of Marxism has taken its place, but neither has any room for a&nbsp;mandate of the people.
Its goal is respect, not dominance.
Why Chinese Companies Stay at Home
Without the decisions taken 20 years ago, atmospheric levels of ozone-depleting substances would have increased ten-fold by 2050.
But this is only part of the story that we celebrate on the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer (September 16).
But they certainly play a significant role.
The Centrists Cannot Hold
But, by and large, the developed democracies are characterized by competition between large parties on the center left and center right.
Can they rebound on their own?
One key issue clouding the future is trade finance.
An accelerated public-investment program that avoids low-return projects is not out of the question.
But some of this criticism of “market fundamentalism” reflects a misunderstanding.
A number of universities are moving in this direction.
It is in higher education that Pakistani women have made extraordinary progress in recent years.
She will begin to be identified with the change that is already underway.
In education, numbers make a revolution.
Why Do Economies Stop Growing?
(In fact, many developing countries have learned this the hard way, but the lessons seem not to have crossed over to advanced countries.)
But they are not sufficient.
EDINBURGH – People with higher intelligence test scores in childhood and early adulthood tend to live longer.
Differences in human intelligence have environmental and genetic causes.
But we do not yet have the full story.
These variables are related to living longer, too.
The problem is that this “explanation” is statistical.
Finding one is a priority.
Many doctors would like to think of pain as a simple sensation that usefully calls disease or injury to our attention.
Most of the time, pain occurs after simple nerve endings detect tissue injury in various ways and generate signals that travel to the spinal cord and from there to the brain.
Unlocking this secret may help doctors prevent, treat, or eliminate some chronic pain disorders. 
Growth Out of Time
The core of his article contrasts the transformational impact of IR #1 and, especially, IR #2 on per capita GDP and the quality of life with the relatively trivial consequences of IR #3.
In 1873, the retailer Montgomery Ward was just a year old, and the first Sears Roebuck catalogue was still 20 years away.
And here, too, Gordon disappoints.
Simply put, the European integration project has hinged on restrictions on national sovereignty.
Consider the United States.
When Florida’s state government goes bankrupt, Florida’s banks continue to operate normally, because they are under federal rather than state jurisdiction.
The relationship between sovereignty and democracy is also misunderstood.
Central bankers, more generally, are typically able to provide short- or medium-term narratives to financial markets.
The narrative should address three essential questions.
Will More Integration Save Europe’s Social Model?
This is obvious for fertility, which is determined by deeper social and demographic trends that cannot really be influenced by government action.
This can happen if the new economic powers are more important as competitors than they are as customers.
The basket was designed in such a way as to result in an average debt-service cost of 4%.
The slightest negative shock could have bankrupted the new federal government.
In the 1830’s and 1840’s, a number of states had over-invested in the leading transport technology of the time –&nbsp;canals.
Here, the President of the World Bank and the Chairman of the OSI discuss the problems that must be addressed.
Of those that go, most do not complete primary school, and less than 1% across Central and Eastern Europe go on to higher education.
Why Financial Pay Shouldn’t be Left to the Market
The answer is clearly no.
But this warning should not carry the day.
Models Behaving Badly
LONDON – “Why did no one see the crisis coming?” Queen Elizabeth II asked economists during a visit to the London School of Economics at the end of 2008.
Consider the facts.
But imprecision is one thing; the systematic overestimate of the economic recovery in Europe is quite another.
This leads us to the second mistake.
The Bank of England hoped that by printing £375 billion of new money, ($600 billion), it would stimulate total spending to the tune of £50 billion, or 3% of GDP.
There is much greater scope for fiscal stimulus to boost growth, and much smaller scope for monetary stimulus.
This is all quite technical, but it matters a great deal for the welfare of populations.
This is a cruel deception.
Hollande in Mali
For Islamic fundamentalists, France is now the “Great Satan.”
That is no longer the case.
Before the intervention, Mali was not a French priority.
But this has changed.
Of course, from a French perspective, the US role is somewhat ironic.
Of course, with unemployment rising every month, it is difficult to remain popular for long.
The French Disconnection
For three decades, this worked.
But that alliance is unraveling as Germany’s own status declines, owing to its mediocre economic performance and the loss of its prestigious Deutschemark.
In short, France has lost control of Europe.
France is also economically wounded.
Yet facts have been hitting hard.
They are alarmed by what they see as the domination of Anglo-Saxon economic principles – the last nail in the coffin of France’s mythical “exception.”
They mistakenly see the European Constitution as one more challenge, at a time when they want to be nursed and protected.
Why Free Trade Matters
Trade is only a facilitating device.
To gain from trade openness, you have to ensure that complementary policies are in place.
In fact, developed countries benefit from trade’s effect on poverty reduction as well.
It is time for the Norwegian Nobel committee to step up again.
NEW YORK – Europe has been in a financial crisis since 2007.
There is a parallel between the ongoing euro crisis and the international banking crisis of 1982.
As in ancient Greek tragedies, misconceptions and a sheer lack of understanding have had unintended but fateful consequences.
Why Greece Will Default
In short, fiscal consolidation would be both easier and less painful if Greece had its own monetary policy.

Why I Published \u0027The Tiananmen Papers\u0027
The Chinese leadership’s penchant for secretiveness is proverbial.
Only then can the true face of history be restored.
Third, change from inside is possible because the Chinese Communist Party today resembles the Communist Party of the Soviet Union around 1989.
The Chinese Communist Party has long since ceased to be a traditional Communist party.
Chinese democracy still has a long, hard road before it.
In terms of floor space, residential construction accounts for half of China’s real-estate investment.
Approximately half of this debt was on their books prior to the crisis.
Labeling time in this way echoes China’s imperial history.
Or the court might test out a new era name after a political debacle, in an effort to wipe the slate clean.
Similarly, “opening” heralded the PRC’s integration into the world community – especially the capitalist West.
In China, people call it fazhan , or “development,” but in much of rest of the world, it is more commonly described simply as the “China Boom,” or the “China Miracle.”
Why is France Burning?
The analogy is misleading.

For the countries they leave, migrants often represent a brain drain.
Even so, they contribute significantly to their home countries.
Obaidullah carried a $1 million reward and was the most senior Taliban captured since November 2001.
Thus, to the chagrin of Afghanistan’s president, Hamid Karzai, Quetta remains a hub of Taliban opposition to his regime.
Some of Musharraf’s achievements are significant.
The US with Iran in Syria
This, in turn, would strengthen the Russia-Iran alliance.
In these circumstances, a US attack on Syria would almost certainly dash any hope of a US-Iran rapprochement for years to come.
Both Iran and the US consider the use of weapons of mass destruction a grave crime.
Obama has his “red line” on the use of chemical weapons.
Since the early 1990s, more foreign direct investment (FDI) has flowed into China than to any country except America.
Of this vast capital inflow, overseas Chinese – from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao and Southeast Asia – delivered the lion’s share.
Discrimination against indigenous private entrepreneurs in China goes beyond finance.
Until recently, private Chinese firms could not export directly to foreign buyers and could not retain foreign exchange earnings.
Is this a plausible explanation as to why Chinese entrepreneurs cede control to expatriates?
A look at other countries may be instructive.
FDI is not the only form of cross-border economic transaction.
A Hong Kong firm can contract out its production in Guangdong province to reap the same labor-savings benefits it would gain from investing in China.
Why Pay More for Fairness?
It is also boosting its purchases of shirts and other goods made with Fairtrade cotton.
That’s a possible strategy, but there are advantages to Fairtrade.
If their product sells well, they can take pride in having produced something that is sought after around the world.
Why Put Charles Taylor on Trial
We are two of Taylor's many victims.
We procured our supplies in Nigeria and exported them to Liberia and Sierra Leone.
In the summer of 1997, David was in Monrovia when Charles Taylor was inaugurated President of Liberia following an eight-year civil war.
Both our home government and friends in Sierra Leone agreed.
Then our plans went awry.
We tried to change our flights and return to Nigeria, but there were no flights available.
Their commander, who spoke with a distinct Liberian accent, called himself Captain Goldteeth.
Then they began to amputate us.
They cut off his hands from beneath the elbow.
Next it was our turn.
Someday, when he grows up, Benedict Jr. will look to us to reconstruct the memories of the father he will never know.

But will it work?
The sad case of the American consumer is a classic example of how this plays out.
As a result, America has created its own generation of zombies – in this case, zombie consumers.
Is this the “cure” that Abe really wants for Japan?
Why Remember Pearl Harbor?
NEW YORK – December 7 marks the 67th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
In fact, Japanese government opinion was so divided that it is surprising that it was able to unite in the end.
Over the course of the summer of 1941, events slowly tilted Japan towards the possibility of war with the West.
But Pearl Harbor was in no way inevitable.
Germany’s attack on the Soviet Union compelled Japan in July 1941 to prepare a plan of attack.
The US froze Japanese assets, an example followed by Britain and the Dutch East Indies.
When Japan responded by taking over southern French Indochina, the US retaliated by imposing an embargo on oil exports to Japan.
World War II in the Pacific finally came about for many different reasons.
On December 1, it was decided that the war would commence in six days.
More immediately, the Great Depression and the subsequent compartmentalization of the world into economic blocs also worked to the advantage of the already powerful.
Moreover, it turned out that US-style capitalism was neither efficient nor stable.
Money does not go to the Cayman Islands because sunshine makes it grow faster; this money thrives on the absence of sunshine.
But Charleroi is state-owned.
Then foregoing landing fees is tantamount to giving Ryanair state aid - the presumption being that the lost revenue must be coming at the expense of Belgian taxpayers.
This is the best possible world for passengers, since nobody forces anyone to spend money in an airport; people do it only because it is convenient.
This simple principle should guide Commission competition decisions.
Ryanair is probably one of these exceptional cases.
After all, there was a far better solution than punishing the airline: force Belgium to privatise the airport.
Once private, Charleroi airport could sign any agreement it wishes, with Ryanair or any other airline.
On one level, that made sense.
China is hardly immune to such a possibility.
Yet China knows that it is time to break that dangerous habit.
Measurement and reporting were neglected.
For developed countries, increasing resilience and flexibility over time by building public assets should be a long-term priority.
But the Iranian regime is no ordinary government; it may not adhere to the normal practices of nuclear restraint.
And it could launch attacks on US, European, and Israeli targets on a global basis.
But the stakes are too high to abandon engagement.
The chief point of intersection between the European and US approaches is major banks.
They were fools more than knaves.
Those that failed were relatively small, like IKB, Bear Sterns, and so on.
Why, then, did the European Commission remain silent?
All include price stability.
Most important, according to the authors, if current trends continue, Asia could soon surpass North America and Europe in global power.
Potential signatories include the US, Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Brunei, Canada, Mexico, and perhaps Japan and South Korea.
ZANZIBAR – Here’s an odd prediction for the coming year: 2013 will be a watershed for financial reform.
Wall Street is pushing back, of course.
Do we need Barclays and UBS to manipulate Libor (a key benchmark for interest rates around the world)?
But what if two or three or seven firms are all in trouble at the same time?
The European debt crisis, for example, remains far from being resolved.
No, they argue.
At the same time, he was careful to let Kohl and others take the lead.
Such self-restraint helped to set the stage for the successful Malta Summit with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev a month later.
Bush famously said that he did not do “the vision thing.”
The trouble reached the boiling point on October 7, when Kurdish fighters killed 13 Turkish soldiers near Turkey’s border with Iraq.
Still, even small-scale military operations would generate risk.
That’s why cooler heads are likely to prevail.
Were the doves right, or just lucky?
Neither the hawks nor the doves (nor anyone else) expected that.
The Fed has printed new bank reserves with reckless abandon.
For the 12 months ending in July, the St. Louis Fed reports that bank reserves rose 31%.
During the same period, a commonly used measure of monetary growth, M2, increased by only 6.8%.
It will take a clearly stated, widely understood strategy – the kind that Paul Volcker introduced in 1979-1982 – to complete the job.
And that is just the first two years.
But Italians are not alone.
Medieval court jesters were often the only ones who could speak truth to despotic kings.
Today, it is often comedians who claim to speak truth to power – and to the public.
Their main interest is in their own business.
The Battle for Water
Water is different from other natural resources.
But the human population has almost doubled since 1970, while the global economy has grown even faster.
The Biology of Luxury
While marketing has contributed to the rise, the luxury market’s robust growth is actually rooted in biology.
While animals use colorful displays and complicated behaviors to signal fitness and strength, humans use luxury goods to demonstrate economic health.
For most animals, males are the performers.
Male birds, for example, often have brightly colored plumage or intricate appendages, such as the Australian lyrebird’s long tail.
A bird that survives, despite inconvenient plumage that slows it down or makes it visible to predators, must be fit, and will likely sire a healthy progeny.
Given that females bear the physical burden of offspring, an unobtrusive appearance is more advantageous – and thus more common – in nature.
This is not the result of efficiency (the most effective cosmetics frequently become pharmaceutical drugs).
Rather, it signals a lifestyle that values the preservation of beauty and youth.
Cosmetics, like all luxury products, gain influence not from their production, or even their purchase, but from their visibility.
Indeed, an expensive item with no label or identifying characteristics has less competitive impact than a recognized item or brand.
False information, such as counterfeit goods, jeopardizes the competition-based selection process.
But mimicry’s success in nature depends on the ratio of the original to the ersatz.
If there are too few of the original, the profile loses its significance, and its protective value vanishes.
Why Wolfensohn Mattered
At the end of this month, James Wolfensohn’s ten-year tenure as President of the World Bank comes to an end.
His commitment to those in the developing world has been contagious.
The response was predictable because Slaughter’s article is one that is published in the US by a revolving cast of powerful (most often white) women every three years or so.
This solution was not framed as a “women’s issue,” but as a family benefit.
And Dutch women have simply moved on, focusing on other interesting goals in their personal and family lives.
Of course, Europe is not gender-equality Nirvana.
The Forte foundation in America has now followed suit with its own list of “board-ready women.”
“But I like what the quotas do.”
WikiLeaks, Secrets, and Lies
The first type is their own sources and methods, which need to be safeguarded if they are to remain effective when gathering data.
The role of the Fourth Estate was particularly important during the administration of President George W Bush.
Perversely, it will lead to greater secrecy.
It seems a high price to pay for gossip.
But there is no place where the transformative power of connectivity is potentially greater than in China, with its reported 420 million Internet users.
Wild about Risk
Measuring risks, especially important long-term ones, is imprecise and difficult.
Virtually none of the economic statistics reported in the media measure risk.
Can anyone believe that this is because Americans are 14 times smarter or 14 times better in character than Indians?
Will America’s Pain be China’s Gain?
The bonfire was sparked by the collapse of the Thai baht in the summer of 1997.
China was one of the world’s most egalitarian societies as late as 1985.
So what lies ahead in 2009?
But this mechanism can be activated only by formal request.
· Competition. Everyone advocates ``fair competition.''
Yet we do not see carbon taxes being adopted.
A cap-and-trade system can cause serious risks to international trade.
There is no easy answer to this problem.
Will China “Lose” the 2008 Olympics?
When the International Olympic Committee awarded Beijing the 2008 Summer Games in July 2001, the announcement ignited wild celebrations across the country.
Indeed, nearly a half-billion Chinese lack access to clean drinking water, and the number of terminally polluted rivers and lakes grows daily.
Even if police are able to maintain order in Beijing, can they extend that control across the country?
Then there is the matter of how the Games will be received in the West.
China has changed since it “won” the 2008 games seven years ago.
Gone will be the evangelism of markets and democracy.
It allows only repression when the government faces protests and opposition outside the established channels.
There are no easy ways out of this dilemma.
If China surmounts these hurdles and does eventually become the world’s predominant economic power, globalization will, indeed, take on Chinese characteristics.
Democracy and human rights will then likely lose their luster as global norms.
That is the bad news.
A minor player in the global economy in the 1980’s, China today is the world’s third largest trading power.
Today, the topic of political reform is taboo.
War between the Koreas would confront Beijing with a flood of hundreds of thousands of refugees.
Equally important, China is wary of the prospect of Korea being unified under South Korean rule and backed up by continued strategic support from the US.
Will Europe Be Willing but Disabled?
For some, it is five minutes to midnight; for others, Europe is a car accelerating towards the edge of a cliff.
Cultural differences persist.
That is where the eurozone is today.
Maintaining a 17-member monetary union is no longer a given.
Talk of countries exiting, starting with Greece (the “Grexit”), is now rampant.
The longer this persists, the harder it will be for politicians to maintain control of their countries’ destinies and that of Europe’s collective enterprise.
I, too, am fond of metaphors.
During a trip to the continent last week, I heard one that captures very well the key dynamic in Europe today.
The eurozone’s leaders are on a raft heading towards a life-threatening waterfall.
Will Europe Learn to Love Bush?
Unfortunately, this “good cop, bad cop” game doesn’t work in international politics.
Will Europe’s Economies Regain Their Footing?
STOCKHOLM – What will Europe’s growth trajectory look like after the financial crisis?
Yet, ugly or not, the downturn will eventually end.
It is not a pretty picture.
The more political power is centralized, the more the central authority can interfere with market development.
Of course, my book cannot be the Mexican stance.
They will wield decisive importance in swing states like Colorado, New Mexico, Florida, and Nevada.
What China lacked was not demand for consumption goods, but a supply of high-quality financial assets.
Recent events have not enhanced the stature of the US as a supplier of high-quality assets.
Meanwhile, the US still has the most liquid financial markets in the world.
After all, it is always better to control one’s own fate.
Indeed, the parallels between financial crises and the threat of cyber meltdowns are striking.
They say that the ability of cyber-terrorists and blackmailers to take the global economy to the brink, as in the 2007 Bruce Willis movie Die Hard 4, is utterly fictional.
But, just as with nuclear power plants, progress can go awry in the absence of good regulation.
Recent revelations about the super-viruses “Stuxnet” and “Flame” are particularly disconcerting.
If Greece still had its own currency, everything would be easier.
This is a situation tailor-made for Strauss-Kahn and the “new IMF” to ride to the rescue.
T he IMF was created in the waning days of World War II, essentially as a United States-West European partnership.
Then the global financial crisis hit, and Strauss-Kahn was propelled to center stage.
Will Greece Make It?
Even more importantly, investors understood this, too.
In January 2009, the country had its worst riots since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Its currency has been pegged to the euro since 2005.
Will Greece be an Argentina or a Latvia?
Other leaders were quoted as saying that Hamas would “lift the siege by force.”
For Palestinians, these are signs of victory.
Will NATO’s Prodigal Son Return?
For starters, the US now has a real friend and ally in the Élysée Palace.
Here, again, strengthening Europe requires strengthening the Alliance.
Will Next Time Be Different?
So how can this one-way betting be stopped?
To many, the duo of Olmert and Peretz seemed to invite trouble.
High home prices are already putting great stress on many families, which are struggling to make their mortgage payments.
After two years of rate increases, Australia's home price boom only recently shows signs of abating.
Then came the news that Brazil will host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games – this coming on top of hosting the 2014 World Cup.
For these and other reasons, Brazil is gaining the world’s attention.
In the poorest region, the North and Northeast, the numbers fall to 8.6% and 8.3%.
The lowest rates were seen on June 13 th .
Ten-year government bonds in the Euro-area yielded 3.54%, while the Euro-area inflation rate was 1.9%.
The history of developed-country bond markets in the last half-century is relatively straightforward.
At the same time, there is no such clear upper bound to inflation.
EMBARGO 6 SEPTEMBER 2004
With the Association agreement of 1963, a special relationship was established, culminating in the customs union of 1996.
With 80 million people, Turkey would be one of the largest EU states.
Moreover, for decades Turkey has been a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to believe that it would act differently in the EU.
Many feel that Turkey simply does not fit into a European society based on Christian traditions and culture.
Will the Euro Dethrone the Dollar?
Is the dollar about to lose the crown of world finance to the euro?
August 1914 provided the opportunity.
Six years later, in April 1925, Britain confirmed its monetary credibility and returned to the gold standard.
But even then, dethroning the reigning king of international exchange takes time.
Today, the euro – a currency without a country – lacks a long track record of credibility.
Thirteen countries in the European Union use the euro as money.
But the commitment of these independent political entities to the euro cannot match the history of America’s commitment to the dollar.
The European Central Bank, established in 1998, has a mandate to manage the new currency to maintain price stability.
It cannot hitch a ride on gold, the way America did a century ago.
Between 2000 and 2005, the dollar lost more than 25% of its value against the euro.
My own sarcastic reaction was to think, “Oh, now the IMF thinks that some of the core eurozone countries are a default risk.”
Simply put, Europe and the US control too much power in the IMF, and their thinking is too dominant.
But the financial crisis should have reminded everyone that the distinction between advanced economies and emerging markets is not a bright red line.
Economic fragility among the world's leading economies is the biggest stumbling block.
Will the Meek Inherit Russia?
The St. Petersburg Economic Forum is mostly for international consumption.
The draft constitution would transform Egypt into a parliamentary republic.
July set new records in England and the Netherlands, where weather data go back more than 300 years.

Heat kills.
More frequent intense hurricanes will kill many more.
Tropical diseases will spread, killing still more people.
Other developed nations with emissions close to those of the US include Australia, Canada, and Luxembourg.
Russia, Germany, Britain, Italy, France, and Spain all have levels between a half and a quarter that of the US.
The question, she reports on www.opendemocracy.net, seemed to take him by surprise, and he did not support the idea.
The department is currently developing the third such review and will release it later this year.
The global configuration of America’s military is also changing.
First, how much conventional war-fighting capability should the US military retain?
Systems such as the F/A-22 Raptor aircraft and the Army’s Future Combat System are extraordinarily expensive.
The strategy that emerges will be only as strong as these assumptions are accurate. 
Will the Sun Still Rise?
So what policies should be implemented in response to these economic blows?
Will the US “Lose” Latin America?
On November 4-5, the fourth Summit of the Americas took place in Mar del Plata, Argentina.
But improving relations with its neighbors to the South will require making commitments at several levels.
Will the US-Japan Alliance Survive?
In the early 1990’s, many Americans regarded Japan as an economic threat.
It is also why it is mistaken to speak of a formal G-2 with China, rather than multilateral cooperation.
Fortunately, this is an area that plays to Japan’s strengths.
The emerging market crisis of 1997-1998 changed all this.
In the broadest terms, we must create a more level playing field.
At present, the US serves as the motor of the global economy.
More urgently, the US motor is sputtering.
KYIV – Ukraine’s parliamentary election on October 28 will be neither free nor fair.
Ukrainian voters are fickle.
They voted against the incumbent powers in the presidential elections of 1994, 2004, and 2010. They may do so again.
Something similar is likely to happen this time around.
Indeed, the United States and the EU, in particular, have a large stake in the outcome.
But rapid change entails immense pain.
Five years into this new era, how should we characterize it?
Terrorism is a form of theater.
By this standard, we are doing badly.
In November 2003, the official number of terrorist insurgents in Iraq was given as 5,000.
The manner in which we use military power also affects Rumsfeld’s ratio.
The ability to combine hard and soft power is smart power.
BERLIN – The United States has waged three wars since Al Qaeda’s terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001: against Al Qaeda, in Afghanistan, and in Iraq.
But where, exactly, does the heart of the New economy lie?
The dynamics of the next 5 years will also reflect a head-on competition between winning corporations.
Boeing versus Airbus may be the most interesting example.
In 5 years, however, Airbus will likely be up and Boeing out of the champions league altogether.
For Boeing became complacent and forgot that the airline business is a cut-throat world.
In fact, effort and education are not what matters most.
The recently established European Globalization Adjustment Fund (EGF) is an EU-wide response to this challenge.
Only around one-quarter are re-employed with a wage at or above the previous level (see chart).

In practice, however, such transfers hardly ever take place, so the potential gains from opening trade may fail to materialize. 
According to some contemporary observers, however, “pent-up demand” was only part of the story.
The Marshall Plan, which operated from 1947 to 1951, became a symbol of this new attitude.
This means paying attention not just to the plan’s technical details, but also to appearances.
This may seem unfair.
Stability will come only when economic opportunities exist, when a bulging generation of young men can find jobs and support families, rather than seeking their fortune in violence.
A war ends.
It’s important to distinguish four distinct phases of outside help to end a conflict.
Instead of sending help, they send study groups.
Yet the window of opportunity closes quickly.
The same applies in Somalia.
But the window of opportunity closes quickly in these and other post-conflict regions.
Revolutions and their aftermaths, of course, are always fluid and fickle times, and the outcome is often perched on a knife’s edge.
Anything less will undermine the transition.
We had to compromise and settle for the best possible results.
Our help had to be targeted.
When I became Indonesia’s finance minister, I had 64,000 employees.

The annual cost per pupil would be $32.
Some of this anxiety is pure racism; but some is not.
Then I witnessed the prototype of a true solution.
But even women who arrive with no higher education or professional skills create an “action plan.”
More than once, I heard them express the view that things were better before the revolutions.
Parliamentary representation for women has also taken a hit.
In Tunisia, the election in 2011 brought 49 women into the 217-seat Constituent Assembly.
In Tunisia, the most Westernized of the Arab countries, women have been attacked at universities and schools, and are being forced to wear the hijab.
Likewise, in Egypt, women protesters face greater scrutiny than men.
Women on Top?
Has this changed the style, indeed, the substance of foreign policy?
Not infrequently this has been helped by explicit policies.
But this is precisely the point.
Young women, especially, suffer from discrimination in the workplace when they are seen as “too” aesthetically appealing.
But attractive.”
Do they ever ask Ben Bernanke, “What’s with the facial hair?
It’s not 1979.”
Today, US political leaders such as Congressman Barney Frank want to bring back unions.

Next March, he will become President of China as well.
How does China’s new leader see the world, and how will he handle the country’s foreign policy?
The answers will determine China’s relations with the world, and vice versa, for the next decade.
He showed interest in American culture, just as Deng did in 1979.

Yankee Bases Go Home
This left the floor open to Chávez to isolate Colombia and preach against the US.
For Chávez is showing that the old cry of “Yankee go home” still resonates.
Stationed for a decade as a KGB agent in the former East Germany, he saw Western democratic and business practices at close hand, and is believed to be committed to them.
President Putin's keen political antenna has caught this trend.
Time and again he has said that Russia's national idea must blend traditional Russian concepts with a new, modern content.
In 1994, his units put down a secessionist movement in the south.
In 2009, Saleh sacked al-Ahmar’s key backers, including Central Command Chief General al-Thahiri al-Shadadi and Lieutenant General Haydar al-Sanhani, from power.
The only decision before him and his thinning ranks of allies is whether to leave peacefully or go down fighting.
Only by stabilizing the bilateral Sino-American relationship can a global system that supports peace and shared prosperity be achieved.
Doomsayers frequently cite the wars that followed Imperial Germany’s rise as a historical parallel to the Sino-American relationship today.

Sweet Caroline in Tokyo
TOKYO – Fifty years have passed since the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy, with official ceremonies held in Washington, DC, and Dallas to commemorate the anniversary.
Waving to the onlookers, she looked like Snow White.
But, rather than airing the speech, the broadcast brought the shocking news of the assassination.
Securing Japan
Zhu Rongji Reexamined
Indeed, Mr. Zhu was renowned for punishing those who fell short of his expectations.
Politicians often make bold promises but rarely keep them.
On July 1, 2001, at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, Mr. Zhu assessed his progress.
That is a political legacy second to none in modern Chinese history.

Zimbabwe’s Permanent Guantánamo
Despite immediate attempts by his lawyers to locate him, his whereabouts remained unknown for days.
So presumably he has a constructive vision for the Bank’s future.
First and foremost, his appointment extends the embarrassingly outmoded practice of always installing an American in the job.
Zoellick’s background as a lawyer hardly makes him perfect for the job, either.
The biggest question mark, though, is whether Zoellick will be able to hit the ground running and implement desperately needed reforms.
Reform number one, of course, is to ensure that the next World Bank President is not an American.
But all this knowledge shouldn’t be free.
In any case, let’s wish him luck.
Until now, populism has been the missing note in African political culture.
Moreover, Zuma has been called a chameleon, accused of telling his audiences what they want to hear.
