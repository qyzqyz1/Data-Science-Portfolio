# Machine Learning Projects in Python

- [Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Supervised%20-%20Finding%20Donors%20for%20CharityML): Identified potential supervised learning algorithms and conducted their Python implementations to help a fictitious charity organization, CharityML, to predict potential donors based on multiple features. Compared model performances and further improved the chosen model through parameter tuning technique.
	
- [Python ML Micro Projects](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Python%20ML%20Micro%20Projects): Various micro projects involving Python implementations of different machine learning algorithms (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, random forests, and building of a recommendation system).  
	
- [Apache Spark Python Micro Projects](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Apache%20Spark%20ML%20Micro%20Projects): Various micro projects involving Apache Spark Python implementations of different machine learning algorithms (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, random forests, k-means clustering, and natural language processing).  
	
- [Deep Learning Micro Projects](https://github.com/qyzqyz1/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Python%20Projects/Python%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Deep%20Learning%20Micro%20Projects): Various micro projects involving Python implementations of different deep learning/ neural network topics (e.g. multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, and training model through stochastic gradient descent and regularization).
